The main partners of the project were \\nthe key institutions in the NQIS, such as the Ministry of Economy of Ukraine, the National \\nStandardization Body (SE “UkrNDNC” - State Enterprise “Ukrainian Scientific Research and Training \\nCenter for Standardization, Certification and Quality Problems”), the National Accreditation Agency of \\nUkraine. The project also worked in close cooperation with two laboratories in the country: SE \\n\"Krivbasstandartmetrology\" (located in Kriviy Rig) and Regional Testing Center \"BM-TEST\" (located in \\nRivne). The original project budget of EUR 880,000 (incl. 13 percent) was increased in 2022 to EUR \\n1,060,000 (incl. 13 percent.), tapping on to currency exchange gains at the level of the Global \\nProgramme. \\n\\nSeveral results have been achieved as part of the Phase I intervention. The National Standards Body \\n(UAS) was prepared to adhere to ISO Good Standardization Practice. Their communication strategy \\nwas developed to enhance engagement with key stakeholders. A Draft of National Standardization \\nStrategy was prepared and 18 standards for windows have been adopted. The project also supported \\nthe digitalisation of the national QI, including through an analysis and development of a roadmap to \\ndigitalize the standardisation process (UAS Digital Transformation Action Plan). A new online store for \\nthe sale of standards is under development and the web portal of the NAAU was updated. The \\ncapacities of the two testing laboratories were strengthened, including through training, \\nestablishment of linkages with businesses, purchasing of equipment, international exposure and \\naccess to relevant standards. Several awareness sessions were conducted, and technical guidelines \\n(e.g. CE marking) were developed to facilitate the adoption of standards among local producers. \\n\\nFollowing the outbreak of war in 2022 (and associated changes to meet the needs for reconstruction \\nand recovery) Ukraine put forward a National Recovery Plan that aims to capitalize on the \\nreconstruction efforts and make sure that these are guided by and serve as a springboard for \\nsustainability. As a separate component of the programme, therefore, and to leverage the work \\nalready carried out, a “Roadmap for the development of a National Guiding Framework for the use of \\nStandards and Technical Regulations in the Green Reconstruction of Ukraine” was developed. \\n\\nIn this way, building on the success of the first programme phase, the Government of Ukraine, UNIDO \\nand SECO agreed to continue the efforts of the global GQSP, in form of a second phase with a duration \\nof five years (2022-2027). Following consultations with the key national institutions, SECO and \\nconsidering the circumstances presented above, a decision was made to identify a new focus sector \\nfor GQSP Ukraine for the Phase II. To this end, a preliminary assessment of the most promising VCs \\nwas conducted. This considered the country needs, such as economic recovery, integration with the \\nEU market stipulated in the Ukrainian Recovery Plan (Jul 2022)3 and united with SECO priorities and \\nUNIDO expertise. The pre-selection of the three most promising sectors/VCs was presented in the \\ndocument ‘’Analysis of pre-selected priority sectors in Ukraine for the second phase of the Project in \\nUkraine”. As a result of the analysis, the Fruit and vegetable sector with two main product groups: \\nberries and nuts, was identified as most suitable for the second phase of GQSP Ukraine. Following this \\nassessment an intervention logic for the Phase II project in Ukraine has been designed.  \\n\\nTherefore, the Phase II of the project anchors on the further development and support to NQIS in \\nUkraine with the specific focus on berries and nuts value chains, and organic products where relevant. \\nMeanwhile, to ensure that all efforts from Phase I are brought to an impactful conclusion the project \\nwill further support strategic activities in the wood sector. These activities will focus on building \\n\\n                                                           \\n\\n3 https://global-\\n\\nuploads.webflow.com/621f88db25fbf24758792dd8/62c166751fcf41105380a733_NRC%20Ukraine%27s%20Rec\\n\\novery%20Plan%20blueprint_ENG.pdf  \\n\\nhttps://global-uploads.webflow.com/621f88db25fbf24758792dd8/62c166751fcf41105380a733_NRC%20Ukraine%27s%20Recovery%20Plan%20blueprint_ENG.pdf\\nhttps://global-uploads.webflow.com/621f88db25fbf24758792dd8/62c166751fcf41105380a733_NRC%20Ukraine%27s%20Recovery%20Plan%20blueprint_ENG.pdf\\nhttps://global-uploads.webflow.com/621f88db25fbf24758792dd8/62c166751fcf41105380a733_NRC%20Ukraine%27s%20Recovery%20Plan%20blueprint_ENG.pdf\\n\\n\\n7 \\n \\n\\ncapacities of selected testing laboratories and linkages with private sector associations. Hereby, the \\nPhase II will focus on three main outcomes: (i) Strengthening QI institutions, (ii) Empowering the \\nbusiness sector, and (iii) Promoting quality culture and a conducive policy framework. This framework, \\nwhich is to be carried out with complementary interventions from international actors (such as SIPPO \\nand QFTP) in the country, should support Ukraine’s economic development, sustainability and \\ncountries’ recovery and tapping into further opportunities under the Deep and Comprehensive Free \\nTrade Area (DCFTA) and the Free Trade Agreement (FTA) with the European Free Trade Association \\n(EFTA). Phase II will be implemented in the period of four years (2023-2027) with the Ministry of \\nEconomy of Ukraine – Department of Technical Regulations being the main counterpart. The total \\nbudget of the technical assistance is EUR 1,243,000.  \\n\\nA. BACKGROUND  \\n\\nA.1. GQSP Ukraine Phase I \\n\\nThe Global quality and standards programme (GQSP) is a global initiative developed by UNIDO and \\nSECO that identifies quality-related challenges and makes targeted interventions at every stage of the \\nvalue chain, thereby increasing compliance with international market requirements and ultimately \\nhelping countries engage in global trade. The first phase of the GQSP was implemented between 2017 \\nand 2023 and it assisted 12 countries worldwide to boost their competitiveness in 16 specific sectors. \\n\\nThe GQSP Ukraine Phase II builds on the Phase I which focused on processed wood sector. In \\nSeptember 2019, the GQSP Ukraine (Phase I) was launched with an initial duration of 3 years. As a \\nresult of external circumstances faced during the implementation of the project (such as the COVID-\\n19 pandemic and the outbreak of the war in the country), the Ukrainian Ministry of Economy, UNIDO \\nand SECO agreed on an extension of the project until November 2023, in line with the Global \\nProgramme. The original project budget of EUR 880,000 (incl. 13 percent) was also increased in 2022 \\nto EUR 1,060,000 (incl. 13 percent.), tapping on currency exchange gains at the level of the Global \\nProgramme and extending the duration until November 2023.  \\n\\nThe main objective of the Phase I was to strengthen the quality and standards compliance services for \\nUkrainian SMEs in the sector of wood and wood processed products, particularly targeting windows \\nand children furniture. To this end, the project pursued three outcomes: \\n\\n\\uf0b7 Outcome 1: Technical policy compliance. Technical competence and sustainability of the \\nUkrainian QI is enhanced. \\n\\n\\uf0b7 Outcome 2: SMEs’ awareness. SMEs’ awareness of the need to comply with international \\nstandards and technical regulations is enhanced. \\n\\n\\uf0b7 Outcome 3: Quality culture. A culture for quality is promoted. \\n\\nTable 1. Summary of outputs and outcomes of Phase I \\n\\n Outcome 1 Outcome 2 Outcome 3 \\n\\n Technical competence and \\nsustainability of the \\nUkrainian NQIS that serve \\nthe selected VC is enhanced. \\n\\nSMEs’ capacity to comply \\nwith international standards \\nand technical regulations is \\nenhanced. \\n\\nA culture for quality \\n\\npromoted. \\n\\n \\n\\nOutputs ISO assessment and action \\nplan for implementation of \\nGood Standardization \\nPractices in the UAS.  \\n\\nA number of capacity \\nbuilding workshops were \\nheld for manufacturers of \\nwooden windows and \\nchildren\\'s furniture on: EU \\nrules and regulations, \\ntechnical aspects of EU \\nproduct safety requirements, \\n\\nPrepared brochures, \\npresentations and recordings \\nof trainings for producer.  \\n\\n\\n\\n8 \\n \\n\\n Outcome 1 Outcome 2 Outcome 3 \\n\\nEU markets (standards, legal \\naspects, consumer \\nrequirements and product \\nfeatures). \\n\\nOutputs Development of an analysis \\nand roadmap for the \\ndigitalisation of the \\nstandardisation process.  \\n\\nDevelopment of a \\npublication “Economic \\nbenefits of using standards \\nfor SMEs, in particular for \\nmanufacturers of wooden \\nwindows and children’s \\nfurniture”.  \\n\\nA number of trainings were \\nheld, and relevant \\ncertificates were issued for \\nemployees of the Ministry of \\nEconomy and NAAU on \\nglobal trends in regulation \\nand accreditation. \\n\\nOutputs Development of an online \\nplatform for UAS to sell \\nstandards and new web \\nportal for NAAU.  \\n\\nDevelopment of a guidelines \\n\"CE marking for windows\" \\nand \"CE marking for certain \\ntypes of children’s furniture. \\n\\nAnalysis of the compliance of \\n\\nthe national standardisation \\n\\nsystem of Ukraine with \\n\\nEuropean and international \\n\\nnorms and rules prepared. \\n\\nOutputs \\n\\n \\n\\nDevelopment of the National \\n\\nStandardisation Strategy for \\n\\nUAS.  \\n\\n \\n\\nDevelopment of sections on \\nthe online export promotion \\nplatform for manufacturers \\nof children\\'s furniture and \\nwooden windows. \\n\\nDevelopment of a National \\n\\nGuiding Framework of \\n\\nStandards and Technical \\n\\nRegulations for the Green \\n\\nReconstruction of Ukraine. \\n\\nOutputs \\nCapacity building of two test \\n\\nlaboratories and provision of \\n\\ntest equipment.  \\n\\n \\n\\n  \\n\\nThe main partners of the project were the key institutions in the NQIS, such as the Ministry of Economy \\nof Ukraine, the National Standardization Body (SE “UkrNDNC”), the National Accreditation Agency of \\nUkraine. The project also worked in close cooperation with two laboratories in the country: SE \\n\"Krivbasstandartmetrology\" (Kriviy Rig) and Regional Testing Center \"BM-TEST\" (Rivne). \\n\\nA.2. Lessons learnt from GQSP Ukraine Phase I \\n\\nSeveral results have been achieved as part of the GQSP Phase I in Ukraine. The National Standards \\nBody (UAS) was prepared to adhere to ISO Good Standardization Practice. Their communication \\nstrategy was developed to enhance engagement with key stakeholders. A Draft of the National \\nStandardization Strategy was prepared and 18 standards for windows have been adapted. The project \\nalso supported the digitalisation of the national QI, including through an analysis and development of \\na roadmap to digitalize the standardisation process (UAS/UNIDO Digital Transformation Action Plan). \\nA new online store for the sale of standards is under development and the web portal of the NAAU \\nwas updated. The capacities of the two testing laboratories were strengthened, including through \\ntraining, establishment of linkages with businesses, purchasing of equipment, international exposure \\nand access to relevant standards. Several awareness sessions were conducted, and guidelines were \\ndeveloped to facilitate the adoption of standards among local producers. \\n\\nAt the same time, the Ukrainian wooden windows market has been unstable over the last 4 years, \\nexperiencing a decline in export volumes. It was further impacted by the war, when in 2022 the export \\ndropped by almost 50 percent (with Russian Federation being one of the main countries of destination \\nof wooden products). Meanwhile, as a result of the destruction caused by the war, the internal \\n\\n\\n\\n9 \\n \\n\\ndemand for wooden products, particularly windows, has increased manifold. The production is \\ntherefore now mostly oriented towards the domestic market and to the reconstruction of the country. \\nThis led to revisiting the sectoral focus for the Phase II intervention. \\n\\nGiven the new reconstruction and recovery needs of Ukraine the Phase I of the project has also \\nsupported the development of a National Guiding Framework of Standards and Technical Regulations \\nfor the Green Reconstruction of Ukraine.  \\n\\nThis \"green reconstruction\" provides an opportunity to address pressing challenges and ensure a \\ntransition to sustainable and inclusive development in the post-conflict era. To achieve this goal, it is \\ncrucial to adopt and effectively implement new green practices, which have been codified into \\ninternational standards. When incorporated into technical regulations, they are key in defining \\nspecifications for public and private investment projects, services and their management. \\n\\nReconstruction of physical infrastructure can allow Ukraine to invest in the future, overcoming a \\nsignificant carbon footprint, reducing potential climate impact and increasing energy and resource \\nefficiency - thereby becoming a pioneer of such practices in Europe. At the same time, these \\nreconstruction efforts can help Ukraine to align with European legislation and requirements as part of \\nits EU accession efforts. This has become especially relevant with Ukraine receiving EU Candidate \\nstatus in 2022.  \\n\\nTo contribute to these national efforts, the Phase I project has developed a roadmap that outlines the \\nkey objectives, interested parties (such as national stakeholders, international development partners \\nand others) and milestones, inter alia, for the development of the guiding frameworks. As one of the \\ninitial steps in this process, the project organised a series of workshops under the leadership of UAS \\nand in close cooperation with national and international partners like CEN CENELEC and ISO. The topics \\ncovered by the four workshops are as follows: \\n\\n\\uf0b7 Workshop 1 “The Role of Sustainability Standards and Technical Regulations”. \\n\\n\\uf0b7 Workshop 2 “The role of public procurement”. \\n\\n\\uf0b7 Workshop 3 “Incorporating sustainability issues into project design”. \\n\\n\\uf0b7 Workshop 4 “Conformity Assessment and Market Surveillance”. \\n\\nThe outcomes of this “unexpected” component of the project will reinforce the important role of \\nstandards and technical regulations in Ukraine (including the adoption of European standards and \\ntechnical regulations as part of the EU Acquis initiative) and should also prove to be useful for Phase \\nII of the project (this proposal). In this way, building on Phase I achievement the Phase II of the project \\nin Ukraine will be able to trifold contribute to recovery efforts of Ukraine: namely to green, economic \\nand social transition and collectively support Ukraine in achieving its sustainable recovery aligned with \\nthe EU market integration processes (see Figure 1). \\n\\nFigure 1 General framework for support activities in Ukraine under Phase II \\n\\n\\n\\n10 \\n \\n\\n \\n\\nA.3. Main opportunities for intervention Phase II \\n\\nBuilding on the success of the first programme phase, in line with the Government priorities and \\nstrategies, UNIDO and SECO agreed to continue the efforts during a second phase, with a duration of \\nfour years (2023-2027). This will enable the project to continue providing support to NQIS recovery \\nand will further strengthen the countries trade and economic potential by re-focusing on the sector \\nwith higher export orientation, especially with the European Union. This is especially important as \\nUkraine gained EU Candidate status in 2022.The Phase II of the project will start in December 2023 \\nwith a budget of EUR 1,243,000 (incl. 13% project support costs). \\n\\nFollowing consultations with the Government and SECO and considering that the domestic market will \\nbe the main destination for certain wooden products (such as windows) in the coming years, a decision \\nwas made to identify a new focus sector/VC for this Phase II of the project. A preliminary assessment \\nof the most promising VCs was conducted, considering country needs, SECO priorities and UNIDO \\nexpertise. The pre-selection of the three most promising VCs, is presented in the document ‘’Analysis \\nof pre-selected priority sectors in Ukraine for the second phase of the Project in Ukraine’’, and was \\nbased on objective criteria agreed upon at the global GQSP level, including economic and export \\npotential, the relevance of quality and standards for the sector, the potential for alignment and \\nsynergies and potential risks that can jeopardize the success of the intervention, inter alia. As a result \\nof the analysis, the Fruit and vegetable sector with two main product groups/value chains: berries \\nand nuts, was identified as most suitable and will be the focus for the second phase of GQSP Ukraine.  \\n\\nBuilding on strengthening national QI system the Phase II project in Ukraine will foresee interventions \\nin the following QI elements: \\n\\nStandards \\n\\nThe outcome will aim to strengthen and leverage the technical competence of both UAS and its \\nstakeholders in the sector to develop the capability to agree on industry-driven national standards. \\nUAS needs to be fully conversant with the requirements of the WTO TBT Annex 3 requirements and \\nthe ISO standards development practices and to ensure that these are implemented. The project will \\nsupport the development and dissemination of national adoptions of relevant international or \\nregional (CEN/CENELEC) standards as appropriate for the FV Value Chains. This, in turn, typically leads \\nto greater capacity building on the standards development process and helps stakeholders to stay \\nabreast with what is happening at the international level. It is important that, as an aspiring member \\nof the EU, Ukraine continues to promote adoption of the “Harmonized Approach” to its standards \\ndevelopment activities in order to support compliance by “Presumption of Conformity” to the \\nappropriate Technical Regulations. \\n\\nSUSTAINABLE\\nRECOVERY \\n\\nOF UKRAINE\\n\\nGuiding Framework on standards \\nand technical regulation\\n\\nQuality Infrastructure System \\n(incl. conformity assessment)\\n\\nPrivate sector competitiveness \\n(incl. SMEs)\\n\\nAlignment \\nwith the EU\\n\\nECONOMIC RECOVERY\\n\\nGREEN RECOVERY\\n\\nSOCIAL RECOVERY\\n\\n\\n\\n11 \\n \\n\\nMetrology \\n\\nUkrmetrteststandard (Ukr TEST), as the National Metrology Institute, will be engaged to identify and \\nprovide fit-for-purpose industrial, scientific and legal metrology measurement services as required by \\nthe FV value chain, specifically in the areas where obstacles to export markets have been identified \\n(for example, testing for residual pesticides and bacteria). Capacity building will include traceability of \\nnational standards which need to be used by the testing and metrology measurement laboratories \\n(both industrial and legal metrology). \\n\\nAccreditation \\n\\nThe National Accreditation Agency of Ukraine (NAAU) needs to ensure it has a pool of competent \\ntechnical assessors to be able to assess and accredit the technical scope and competence of the \\nconformity assessment bodies providing services to the FV VC. The technical assessors are required to \\nfulfil the competence requirements defined in ISO/IEC 17011:2017 and EA, ILAC and IAF mandatory \\ndocuments for the scope of work done as requested or covered in the accreditation scope of the CABs. \\n\\nConformity Assessment Service Providers \\n\\nThe project is also expected to strengthen the technical competence of conformity assessment service \\nproviders in Ukraine, but at the same time ensuring that any such services are consistent with market \\ndemand to ensure their ongoing financial viability and sustainability. Suitable institutions to host \\ntesting and certification services required along the FV value chains will be selected and supported to \\ndevelop and implement quality management systems in preparation for accreditation to ensure that \\ninternationally recognized testing and certification services are available to these sectors.  \\n\\nAdditionally, in view of the implementation delays faced during the first phase of the project as a result \\nof the global pandemic and the outbreak of the war, it has also been agreed to incorporate certain ad-\\nhoc activities in the wooden window and children´s furniture sectors during the second phase, to allow \\nfor a meaningful completion of the intervention and the achievement of its objectives. These activities \\nwill focus on capacity building for selected testing laboratories and linkages with the private sector \\nassociations in view of promoting testing services.  \\n\\nB. THE COUNTRY CONTEXT  \\n\\nB.1. Fruit and vegetable sector in Ukraine: global trends, structure and export potential \\n\\nB.1.1. Agriculture in Ukraine \\n\\nFollowing the outbreak of the war, both the Ukrainian government and international financial \\ninstitutions cautioned that the Ukrainian economy would split in two. However, the actual outcome \\nproved to be better than anticipated. The Ukrainian GDP experienced a decline of 29 percent, while the \\noverall export of goods decreased by 35 percent. \\n\\nAgriculture holds a significant position in Ukraine\\'s economy, contributing 20.3 percent to the country\\'s \\nGDP in 2021. This if considering upstream (e.g., agricultural machinery) and downstream (e.g., food \\nprocessing) industries. Ukraine stands among the world\\'s leading producers and exporters of various \\nagri-food products, including sunflower seeds, wheat, sunflower oil, corn, soybeans, rapeseed, barley, \\nwalnuts, honey, and more. Despite challenges of the war, such as disrupted logistics chains, limited \\nresources (both financial and human), continuous missile attacks, and power outages, agricultural and \\nfood products emerged as Ukraine\\'s primary exports, accounting for 53 percent of the country\\'s total \\nexports in 20224. \\n\\nUkraine has a highly developed crop production, in part because to its rich soils with more than 55 \\n\\n                                                           \\n\\n4 World Economic Forum (2022, July 25).

Ukraine is a significant exporter of staple grains, \\nessential supplies for the global food system5. One-third of the world\\'s sunflower oil is produced in \\nUkraine and its exports was worth USD 6.4B in 2021. The country is also the world\\'s ninth-largest \\nproducer and seventh-largest exporter of soybeans with sales totalling approximately USD 600M in \\n2021. It’s the fourth-largest exporter of maize, ranking as the sixth-largest producer in the world with \\nUSD 5.9B worth of exported corn in 2021 with a third going to China and another third heading to the \\nEU6. Ukraine ranks among the top European producers of grain and potatoes and is a major producer \\nof sugar beets and sunflower oil. Although Ukraine\\'s livestock industry lags behind the agricultural \\nindustry, its overall output is still much higher than that of the majority of other European nations. \\nThe forest-steppe zone of Ukraine contains a sizable portion of the world\\'s black soils. These soils are \\nideally adapted for the production of wheat and sugar beets, a significant industrial crop. Other than \\nwheat, which is nearly entirely planted in the fall, Ukraine also grows barley, which is primarily used \\nas animal feed, corn, also used as animal feed, leguminous grains, which are also used as animal feed, \\noats, rye, millet, buckwheat, and rice.  \\n\\nIn terms of exports, Ukraine exported a total of USD 69.1B in 2021, making it the 47th exporter in the \\nworld. During the last five years, the exports of Ukraine have increased from USD 39.7B in 2016 to \\nUSD 69.1B in 2021. As for the agriculture sector, Ukraine exported USD 16B in 2021 in vegetable \\nproducts (wheat, corn, rapeseed, barley, soybeans, other vegetable residues), making it the 13th \\nlargest exporter of vegetable products in the world. The main destinations were China (USD 2.52B), \\nEgypt (USD 1.42B), Turkey (USD 1.09B), Pakistan (USD 726M), and the Netherlands (USD 715M)7. \\nSimilarly, Ukraine exported USD 3.84B in 2021 in foodstuffs, making it the 41st largest exporter of \\nfoodstuffs in the world. For animal and vegetable bi-products, the exportation rate was valued at USD \\n8.13B in 2021. This category covers seed oils (which represent 78percent equivalent to USD 8.34B), \\nsoybean oil (USD 289M), a rapeseed oil (USD 174M), and margarine (USD 83.3M)8. In terms of the EU \\nthe export of agriculture food and feed products (as shown in Figure 2) has significantly increased by \\n45percent from 2016 to 2020.  \\n\\n                                                           \\n\\n5 World Economic Forum (2022, July 25).

Following the EC \\nreport10, as of 2021, Ukraine has been positioned as the fifth-largest supplier of organic products to the \\nEU, with a 6.6 percent share of the European Union\\'s organic product imports. Despite the full-scale \\nwar, in 2022 Ukraine increased its export volume of organic products to Europe (the EU, Switzerland, \\nNorway) by 15.2 percent with cereals, groats, flour, seeds and fruit and vegetable, as major exporting \\nproduct types11. That is why the support for export of organic products within fruit and vegetable \\nsectors, presents strong opportunities for building export potential of Ukraine and will be the scope of \\nthe project.    \\n\\nThe invasion by Russia has severely damaged Ukraine\\'s agricultural industry. Pre-war agricultural \\nexports accounted for USD 27.8B annually, or 41 percent of all Ukrainian exports from the nation. The \\nFood and Agriculture Organization (FAO) calculated that the war had cost Ukraine\\'s agricultural industry \\nbetween USD 4 and USD 6B as of June 2022. Multiple costs will be incurred to repair or replace \\nagricultural gear, lost cattle, and destroyed grain storage facilities12.  \\n\\nThe Ukrainian organic products have also been affected by the war, particularly due to occupation of \\nland, the presence of mined fields, the destruction of farms, warehouses, and infrastructure, a scarcity \\nof fuel and vehicles, and a sharp decline in domestic demand. Nevertheless, Ukraine has managed to \\nexhibit a rise in organic export sales in 2022, and organic production continues to be one of the key \\npriorities for both producers and the government of Ukraine. The Organic Initiative survey in July 2022 \\nshows that most organic producers plan on continuing organic production and not switching to \\nconventional production despite the full-scale war: 42 percent of companies continue organic \\nproduction in full, while 27percent will have to change marketing or sales strategies and 23percent will \\n\\n                                                           \\n\\n9 EU Commission Directorate-General for Agriculture and Rural Development (2021, March 17).

As a \\nresult, losses will continue to accumulate, the farms’ financial situation will deteriorate further, and \\nUkraine’s contribution to global food supplies will fall further below potential. Hence, the assessment \\nof needs presented below, which is based on current estimates of damages and losses, represents a \\nlower bound that will increasingly underestimate true needs with every additional day of destruction \\nand loss caused by Russian military aggression.  \\n\\nPost-war needs can be broken down into three broad categories13: \\n\\n\\uf0b7 Reconstruction – the replacement and repair of destroyed and damaged assets. \\n\\n\\uf0b7 Recovery – the provision of resources, including public services that will enable producers to \\nrestart agricultural production. \\n\\n\\uf0b7 Modernization – taking advantage of the opportunity to not just return Ukrainian agriculture \\nto its pre-war state but, where appropriate, to “build back better” to increase the sector’s \\neconomic and environmental efficiency. \\n\\nBased on the current damages and losses estimates and the Post Disaster Need Assessment \\nmethodology14, KSE Agrocenter15 (2023) projects that Ukrainian agriculture would need USD 23.5 \\nbillion. This estimate includes USD 7 billion for reconstruction and USD 16.5 billion for recovery. \\n\\nB.2.1. Fruit and vegetable sector  \\n\\nThe Fruit and vegetable sector, rank among the top three in terms of both the domestic market of \\nUkraine (prior to the full-scale war) and export volumes. In Ukraine, the collection of wild Fruit and \\nvegetable spans an area of 248,222 hectares. Given the nature of this subsector, its expansion \\npresents an opportunity to generate additional seasonal employment for rural residents, internally \\ndisplaced individuals (IDPs), and women. In 2021, approximately 2,073 tons of products from this \\nsubsector were sold on the domestic market. Two main products groups: berries and nuts are \\ndescribed in the separate section to follow, while general overview of FV below.   \\n\\nThe export volumes of subsector products witnessed a decline of 24 percent in 2022. Apart from \\nfrozen products, there are prospects for value-added production and export, such as beverages (apple \\njuice and birch sap), sauces and jams. Despite the challenges posed by the full-scale war and its \\nassociated negative factors, new players entered Ukraine\\'s organic market in 2022, resulting in the \\nintroduction of more organic processed products such as fruit pastilles and nectarine juice. Currently, \\nthere are 48 Ukrainian producers specializing in Fruit and vegetable, along with four beverage \\nproducers and one jam producer, all poised to expand their export volumes following the outbreak of \\nthe full-scale war. According to forecasts by the Ukrainian Nut Association, the area of nut cultivation \\nin Ukraine is expected to increase from 13.1 thousand hectares in 2022 to 30 thousand hectares by \\n2030. This includes 9 thousand hectares for walnut plantations, 16 thousand hectares for hazelnuts, \\nand 5 thousand hectares for almonds. The association emphasized the prospects of growing organic \\nnuts and highlighted the importance of organic walnut cultivation. According to their predictions, by \\n2030, organic nuts will grow to at least 20 percent of the total nut cultivation area in the country. \\n\\nB.3.3. Fruit and vegetable sector institutions in Ukraine (with focus on berries and nuts)  \\n\\n                                                           \\n\\n13 https://www.cesifo.org/DocDL/econpol-forum-2023-2-cramon-taubadel-nivievskyi-agricultural-perspective.pdf  \\n\\n14 Damage and losses calculated using the Post Disaster Need Assessment methodology developed by the \\n\\nGlobal Facility for Disaster Reduction and Recovery (GFDRR), the World Bank, the EU, and the United Nations \\n\\n(GFDRR 2017) \\n\\n15 https://kse.ua/war-impacts-on-ukrainian-agriculture/  \\n\\nhttps://www.cesifo.org/DocDL/econpol-forum-2023-2-cramon-taubadel-nivievskyi-agricultural-perspective.pdf\\nhttps://kse.ua/war-impacts-on-ukrainian-agriculture/\\n\\n\\n15 \\n \\n\\nThere is a number of private (and public-private) organization representing fruit and vegetable sector: \\n\\n\\uf0b7 Ukraine Berries Association16 is a business association that combines all professional players of \\nfruit and berry market. The members of Ukrainian Berries Association are exclusively legal entities \\nwhich are specialized on the growing and processing of berries and stone fruit, supplying of \\nplanting material, plant protection products, material and technical resources and etc., \\ncooperatives, public organizations, educational institutions and other representatives of the \\nsector. \\n\\n\\uf0b7 Ukrainian Horticultural Association17 is a business association that combines all professional \\nplayers of fruit and berry market. The members of Ukrainian Berries Association are exclusively \\nlegal entities which are specialized on the growing and processing of berries and stone fruit, \\nsupplying of planting material, plant protection products, material and technical resources. \\n\\n\\uf0b7 Ukrainian Agribusiness Club (UCAB)18 is Ukrainian non-governmental organization, lobbying \\nagribusiness interests. The main UCAB activities include - Training and research, Lobbying, Work \\nwith Media and Participation and organization of trade fairs and exhibitions. \\n\\n\\uf0b7 Ukrainian Agrarian Confederation (UAC)19 a Ukrainian community association (UAC) established \\nin order to protect interests of its members and carry out its statutory activities. UAC is governed \\nby the Constitution of Ukraine, the Law of Ukraine on Citizens’ Associations, existing legislation, \\nand this Statute.  \\n\\nUkraine cluster alliance (UCA)20 is a national platform/ association connecting sector associations \\nacross Ukraine, including representative organizations from agri-food sector. \\n\\nB.3.4. Main bottlenecks in Ukrainian Fruit and vegetable sector (with focus on berries and nuts) \\n\\nIn order to secure economic growth as well as international market access Ukraine has to diversify and \\nincrease value of its fruit and vegetable sector products. This would also increase Ukraine current \\nintegration into European and GVCs. Some of the main challenged faced by exporters are: i) Complying \\nwith the technical regulations and standards applied by the EU; ii) Significant certification costs \\nassociated to compliance with technical regulations and standards; iii) Loosing market opportunities \\ndue lack of sustainability standards and traceability schemes assuring product quality along the whole \\nsector. Overpassing these challenges is especially important now in light of Ukraine receiving the EU \\nCandidate status in 2022. A detailed overview of the key sectoral challenges and opportunities is \\npresented in Annex 5 and shortly elaborated below:  \\n\\nChallenges for FV sector  \\n\\n1. Limited awareness of local producers of European and international rules and norms of \\nproduction. \\n\\n2. Limited awareness of local producers of quality and standards compliance. \\n3. Insufficient involvement of SMEs and other businesses in QI processes (low level of \\n\\ninvolvement of the highly qualified personnel of the private sector in TCs activities, in the \\nprocesses of developing technical regulations, training). \\n\\n4. Insufficient number of standards adopted by translating into the Ukrainian language. \\n5. Low level of involvement of national TCs in the work of the mirror international and European \\n\\nTCs. \\n6. Inconsistency in the number of conformity assessment bodies for compliance with the \\n\\nnomenclature and the volume of products produced in Ukraine. \\n\\n                                                           \\n\\n16 https://uaberries.com/en/about-association  \\n\\n17 https://fruit-ukraine.org/eng/about-us/  \\n\\n18 https://ucab.ua/en  \\n\\n19 http://agroconf.org/en/content/statute  \\n\\n20 https://www.clusters.org.ua/en/members/  \\n\\nhttps://uaberries.com/en/about-association\\nhttps://fruit-ukraine.org/eng/about-us/\\nhttps://ucab.ua/en\\nhttp://agroconf.org/en/content/statute\\nhttps://www.clusters.org.ua/en/members/\\n\\n\\n16 \\n \\n\\n7. Limited level of awareness of staff of conformity assessment bodies, labs, auditors in the field \\nregarding compliance with European and international norms and requirements. \\n\\nOpportunities for FV sector  \\n\\n1. Activation and better monitoring of the activities of national TCs in accordance with EU rules \\nand regulations in connection with military aggression (development of procedures and rules \\nfor the involvement of SMEs and other businesses in the activities of TCs, increasing \\nparticipation of private sector in the TCs, increasing participation of national TCs in the work \\nof mirror European and international TCs). \\n\\n2. Implementation of independent international/European monitoring of the state of \\ndevelopment and activity of conformity assessment bodies, testing laboratories, national TCs \\nand traceability of national standards. \\n\\n3. Development of a mechanism for a comprehensive non-duplicative assessment and \\nmonitoring function of conformity assessment bodies and testing laboratories of NAAU and \\nthe responsible authority. \\n\\n4. Development of new strategic program documents regarding the recovery of Ukraine\\'s \\neconomy (updating the QI development plan, need to reassess the draft and finalize the \\nstrategy of standardization, developing the plan for restoring the traceability of national \\nstandards, lifting the moratorium on inspections, etc.). \\n\\nDigitization of processes and keeping registers in the field of standardization, metrology, accreditation \\nand conformity assessment, which can contribute to better dissemination of standards/awareness \\nraising about QI Institutions, transparency, provision of services remotely in view of mobility \\nrestrictions, etc. \\n\\nB.2. Main product groups: berries and nuts \\n\\nB.2.1. Berries \\n\\nUkraine has a diverse climate and suitable conditions for growing various types of berries. The \\nproduction of these crops has been steadily increasing in recent years. Some of the most commonly \\ngrown berries in Ukraine include: \\n\\n\\uf0b7 Strawberries: Strawberries are one of the most popular and widely cultivated berries in \\nUkraine. They are often grown for fresh consumption and processing into products like jam \\nand preserves. \\n\\n\\uf0b7 Raspberries: Raspberries, including red and black varieties, are another staple in Ukraine\\'s \\nberry production. Red raspberries are particularly common and are exported to international \\nmarkets. \\n\\n\\uf0b7 Blueberries: Blueberry cultivation has been on the rise in Ukraine due to increasing demand \\nfor this health-conscious fruit, both domestically and for export. \\n\\n\\uf0b7 Currants: Black currants and red currants are grown in Ukraine and are used for various \\npurposes, including juice production and fresh consumption. \\n\\n\\uf0b7 Gooseberries: Gooseberries are also cultivated, although they are not as widely grown as \\nsome other berries. \\n\\nMarket development and exports  \\n\\nUkraine has seen a steady increase in berry production in recent years, driven by both domestic and \\nexport demand. The exact production figures can vary from year to year due to weather conditions \\nand other factors. Ukraine produced approximately 160,000 metric tons of berries in 2020, according \\nto the State Statistics Service of Ukraine. Within its strawberries accounted for a significant portion of \\nthe total berry production, with approximately 80,000 metric tons produced in 2020. Raspberries, \\nincluding red and black varieties, were also substantial, with around 25,000 metric tons produced in \\n2020. \\n\\n\\n\\n17 \\n \\n\\nUkraine has been actively exporting fruit and berries to various international markets. Ukraine \\nexported approximately 22,000 metric tons of berries in 2020, with strawberries and raspberries being \\nthe primary exports. The European Union is a significant destination for Ukrainian fruit exports, and \\nefforts have been made to meet EU quality and safety standards. The total value of Ukrainian berry \\nexports in 2020 was estimated at around USD 62 million. Ukraine also has a growing berry processing \\nindustry, with berries used in the production of jams, juices, and frozen products for both domestic \\nconsumption and export. \\n\\nMarket Trends and Future Prospects \\n\\nThe demand for berries, both domestically and in export markets, is expected to continue growing \\ndue to increasing awareness of their health benefits and versatility in culinary applications. Export \\nopportunities, especially to the European Union, are expected to expand as Ukraine aligns with \\ninternational quality and safety standards. There is growing interest in organic and sustainably grown \\nberries, presenting opportunities for Ukrainian producers to tap into the organic market segment. \\n\\nStrengths: \\n\\n\\uf0b7 Climatic Diversity: Ukraine\\'s diverse climate and geography allow for the cultivation of a wide \\nvariety of berry species, offering the potential for year-round production. \\n\\n\\uf0b7 Abundant Agricultural Land: Ukraine has a substantial amount of arable land, which can be \\nutilized for berry cultivation, providing room for expansion. \\n\\n\\uf0b7 Increasing Export Opportunities: Growing demand for berries, especially in the European \\nUnion, has opened up export opportunities for Ukrainian berry growers, contributing to \\nrevenue growth. \\n\\n\\uf0b7 Domestic Consumption: Berries are popular among Ukrainians for fresh consumption and \\nprocessing into various products like jams and juices, creating a stable domestic market. \\n\\nWeaknesses: \\n\\n\\uf0b7 Quality Control Issues: Maintaining consistent quality standards for exported berries can be a \\nchallenge. Ensuring quality and meeting international standards is crucial for expanding export \\nmarkets. \\n\\n\\uf0b7 Infrastructure: Insufficient infrastructure, particularly in rural areas where many berries are \\ngrown, can hinder efficient harvesting, storage, and transportation. \\n\\n\\uf0b7 Weather Vulnerability: Ukraine\\'s berry crops are susceptible to weather fluctuations, such as \\nlate frosts and extreme heat, which can affect yields and quality. \\n\\nOpportunities: \\n\\n\\uf0b7 Export Growth: There is significant potential for expanding berry exports, particularly to \\nneighbouring European markets, where there is a growing demand for fresh and high-quality \\nberries. \\n\\n\\uf0b7 Value Addition: The processing industry, including the production of jams, juices, and frozen \\nproducts, offers opportunities for value addition and diversification of berry-related products. \\n\\n\\uf0b7 Organic and Healthy Trends: As global consumer trends shift toward healthier and organic \\nfood options, Ukrainian berries can tap into this market segment by promoting organic and \\nsustainably grown products. \\n\\n\\uf0b7 Challenges in the berry sector include quality control, post-harvest handling, and the need for \\nimproved infrastructure and packaging to meet export requirements. \\n\\nThreats: \\n\\n\\uf0b7 Competition: Ukraine faces competition from other berry-producing countries, both within \\nEurope and globally. Price competition can be intense in international markets. \\n\\n\\uf0b7 Pest and Disease Pressure: Pests and diseases can pose a threat to berry crops, requiring \\n\\n\\n\\n18 \\n \\n\\neffective pest management strategies and investment in research and development. \\n\\n\\uf0b7 Regulatory Challenges: Meeting the regulatory and quality standards of international markets, \\nsuch as the European Union, can be challenging and requires ongoing compliance efforts. \\n\\n\\uf0b7 Market Fluctuations: Market prices for berries can be volatile, and economic or political \\nuncertainties can impact trade and export opportunities. \\n\\n\\uf0b7 Climate Change: Climate change may bring unpredictable weather patterns that could affect \\ncrop yields and quality in the long term. \\n\\n\\uf0b7 To thrive in the berry market, Ukrainian producers and stakeholders should focus on \\nimproving quality control, investing in infrastructure, and diversifying product offerings. \\n\\nB.2.2. Nuts (walnuts) \\n\\nUkraine primarily cultivates two main walnut varieties, the common walnut (Juglans regia) and the \\nblack walnut (Juglans nigra). Common walnuts are the most widely grown variety. \\n\\nMarket development and exports  \\n\\nUkraine is one of the leading walnut producers in Europe. The country\\'s walnut production has been \\nsteadily increasing in recent years due to favourable climate conditions and growing demand for \\nwalnuts in both domestic and international markets. Ukraine produced approximately 105,000 metric \\ntons of walnuts in 2020, making it one of the top walnut-producing countries in Europe. \\n\\nUkraine exported around 46,000 metric tons of walnuts in 2020 with the valued at approximately USD \\n80 million. Ukrainian walnuts are exported to various countries, with the European Union being a \\nsignificant destination. Other key export markets include Turkey, China, and the Middle East. Export \\nvolumes have been on the rise until 2022. The European Union is a key market for Ukrainian walnuts. \\nIn 2020, Ukraine exported approximately 26,000 metric tons of walnuts to EU countries, accounting \\nfor a significant share of total exports. \\n\\nMarket Trends and Future Prospects \\n\\nThe demand for walnuts is expected to continue growing, domestically and in export markets, due to \\nthe perceived health benefits associated with walnut consumption. There is increasing interest in \\norganic and sustainably grown walnuts, presenting opportunities for Ukrainian producers to tap into \\nthe organic market segment.  \\n\\nStrengths: \\n\\n\\uf0b7 Climatic Conditions: Ukraine\\'s climate is well-suited for walnut cultivation, particularly in \\nregions with temperate climates and well-distributed rainfall. \\n\\n\\uf0b7 Vast Agricultural Land: Ukraine has a significant amount of arable land, which can be utilized \\nfor walnut orchards, offering the potential for expansion. \\n\\n\\uf0b7 Export Opportunities: There is a growing demand for walnuts in international markets, \\nincluding Europe and Asia. Ukraine\\'s location as a bridge between Eastern Europe and Asia \\nprovides strategic export advantages. \\n\\n\\uf0b7 Quality of Walnuts: Ukrainian walnuts are known for their quality, which can be a competitive \\nadvantage in international markets. \\n\\nWeaknesses: \\n\\n\\uf0b7 Quality Control and Consistency: Maintaining consistent quality standards can be a challenge, \\nparticularly for small-scale producers. Ensuring uniformity in walnut size, appearance, and \\ntaste is essential for export markets. \\n\\n\\uf0b7 Infrastructure: Inadequate post-harvest handling and storage facilities can lead to post-\\nharvest losses and affect walnut quality. \\n\\n\\uf0b7 Market Concentration: The walnut market in Ukraine may be dominated by a few large \\nplayers, limiting opportunities for smaller growers. \\n\\n\\n\\n19 \\n \\n\\nOpportunities: \\n\\n\\uf0b7 Export Growth: There is a significant potential for expanding walnut exports, particularly to \\nEuropean and Asian markets, where demand for healthy nuts is rising. \\n\\n\\uf0b7 Value Addition: Walnut processing, including shelling, packaging, and producing walnut-based \\nproducts like oils and snacks, offers opportunities for value addition and diversification. \\n\\n\\uf0b7 Organic and Health Trends: As consumer preferences shift towards healthier and organic \\nproducts, Ukrainian walnuts can tap into this market segment by promoting organic and \\nsustainably grown nuts. \\n\\nThreats: \\n\\n\\uf0b7 Competition: Ukraine faces competition from other walnut-producing countries, including the \\nUnited States, China, and Iran. Price competition can be intense in international markets. \\n\\n\\uf0b7 Pest and Disease Pressure: Walnut orchards can be susceptible to pests and diseases, \\nrequiring effective pest management strategies and investment in research and development. \\n\\n\\uf0b7 Climate Change: Climate change may bring unpredictable weather patterns that could affect \\nwalnut yields and quality in the long term. \\n\\n\\uf0b7 Trade Regulations: Changes in trade regulations and tariffs, particularly in key export markets, \\ncan impact walnut exports. \\n\\n\\uf0b7 Market Fluctuations: Market prices for walnuts can be volatile, and economic or political \\nuncertainties can affect trade and export opportunities. \\n\\nB.3. Main national policies and strategies \\n\\nB.2.1. Agriculture policies \\n\\nUkraine’s legislation provides for a range of instruments to support agricultural market development \\nin Ukraine. These include tariff protection, non-tariff trade regulation, and various forms of domestic \\nprice measures. For example, The “Concept of Rural Development in Ukraine until 2025” (2015), that \\nprovides priorities for the development of rural areas in Ukraine, The Law “On State Support of \\nAgriculture in Ukraine” (2014), that sets the basis for priorities and measures of agricultural policy, or \\nThe “Strategy for attracting private investment in agriculture for the period until 2023” (2019), that \\naims to increase agricultural exports, ensure national food security, and improve effectiveness and \\nsustainable growth of the agricultural sector.(list of additional relevant laws and regulation is referred \\nto in Annex 6).  \\n\\nOverall, agricultural producers are eligible for a Single Tax which is set as a percentage of agricultural \\nland value, established on 1 July 1995 and adjusted since with the general consumer price index. At \\npresent, the Single Tax replaces three taxes – profit tax, land tax (for land used in agricultural \\nproduction), and special water use fee – with agricultural producers liable to all other taxes previously \\nincluded in the Single Tax. It generates implicit tax benefits to agricultural producers which for recent \\nyears were estimated to be around USD 158 million annually. Another relevant measure to support \\nagriculture is the establishment of a new Fund for Partial Credit Guarantee in Agriculture. It provides \\ncredit guarantees to small and medium-sized farms, and agriculture enterprises cultivating up to 500 \\nhectars of land. Legislation was also passed introducing state support for agriculture insurance, \\nreimbursing agricultural producers with up to 60percent of the costs of insurance payments.  \\n\\nAn important milestone was the resolution on the functioning of the State Agrarian Register (2021), \\nthat approves the procedure for maintaining and administrating the State Agrarian Register and its \\ndata. The Register was created in November 2020 as a single state information system to integrate \\ninformation on agriculture producers and their property. Since 2002, a moratorium on the sale of \\nagricultural land bans selling farmland in Ukraine, although leasing for cultivation is permitted. The \\nmoratorium has been extended annually until and including 2019. As of July 2021, citizens of Ukraine \\n\\n\\n\\n20 \\n \\n\\ncan purchase up to 100 hectares of land, while this is scheduled to extend to purchase up to 10 000 \\nhectares from January 2024 by Ukrainian citizens and Ukraine legal entities21.  \\n\\nB.2.2. FTAs and other export/sector policies  \\n\\nThe Deep and Comprehensive Free Trade Area (DCFTA) as part of Association Agreement between \\nthe European Union and Ukraine was signed in 2014 and represents an important agreement for trade \\nin agriculture (and other sectors) between the two parties. The European Union opened tariff rate \\nquotas for duty-free imports for Ukraine’s principal agro-food products, such as grain, meat and milk \\nproducts, and sugar, and grants free access for the others. Ukraine reduced import duties for a number \\nof goods imported from the European Union. About 40 percent of agriculture-related import duties \\nwere reduced to zero immediately after the Agreement entered into force, and around a half of import \\nduties will be eliminated during the transition period. It is especially important now in light of Ukraine \\nreceiving the EU Candidate status in 2022. Ukraine has also signed (on 24 June 2010), a Free Trade \\nAgreement (FTA) with the European Free Trade Association (EFTA22) (in force since 1 June 2012)23. The \\nFTA has a comprehensive coverage, including trade in agricultural goods.  \\n\\nSome reforms and recent laws were also introduced under DCFTA especially to improve sanitary \\nstandards for the export of animal products. By February 2021 EU veterinary services had certified \\nfour poultry plants and 26 dairy processing enterprises, permitting them to export to the European \\nUnion. In October 2021, the Ukraine Parliament adopted the law On amendments to certain legislative \\nacts of Ukraine concerning the harmonisation of the legislation of Ukraine in the field of childhood \\nnutrition with EU legislation. This includes changes in product labelling, the abolition of ineffective and \\nburdensome requirements, and strengthening compliance with relevant technical standards and \\nregulations. Since 2022 the European Union has abolished import tariffs and quotas on Ukrainian \\nexports and suspended additional official controls on organic products originating from Ukraine. The \\ndecision was prolonged till June 2024.  \\n\\nMain competent authorities that are involved in the export of agriculture products to EU from Ukraine \\nside are Ministry of Agrarian Policy and Food of Ukraine (MAPF)24 (more see sect B.3.2.), Ministry of \\nEconomy of Ukraine (MEU)25 (more see sect B.3.2),  State Customs Service of Ukraine26 (regulates \\nand controls the export-import of good from and to Ukraine), State Service of Ukraine on Food Safety \\nand Customer Protection27 (assures safety of food products and protects customers), Ukrainian \\nChamber of Commerce and Industry28 (information support for trade to private sector) and on the EU \\nside: the European Commission Directorate-General for Health and Food Safety (DG SANTE)29 \\n(responsible for EU policy on food safety and health and for monitoring the implementation of related \\nlaws). \\n\\nThe main barrier for trade integration under DC FTA remains Ukraine’s difficulty in complying with \\nEU food safety, veterinary and phytosanitary requirements. Thus, the DCFTA contains provisions for \\n\\n                                                           \\n\\n21 https://read.oecd-ilibrary.org/agriculture-and-food/agricultural-policy-monitoring-and-evaluation-\\n\\n2022_ee86a0b9-en#page1  \\n\\n22 EFTA is the intergovernmental organisation of Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland  \\n\\n23 https://www.efta.int/free-trade/free-trade-agreements/ukraine  \\n\\n24 https://minagro.gov.ua/en  \\n\\n25 https://www.me.gov.ua/?lang=uk-UA  \\n\\n26 https://customs.gov.ua/en/  \\n\\n27 https://dpss.gov.ua  \\n\\n28 https://ucci.org.ua/en/about  \\n\\n29 https://commission.europa.eu/about-european-commission/departments-and-executive-agencies/health-and-\\n\\nfood-safety_en  \\n\\nhttps://read.oecd-ilibrary.org/agriculture-and-food/agricultural-policy-monitoring-and-evaluation-2022_ee86a0b9-en#page1\\nhttps://read.oecd-ilibrary.org/agriculture-and-food/agricultural-policy-monitoring-and-evaluation-2022_ee86a0b9-en#page1\\nhttps://www.efta.int/free-trade/free-trade-agreements/ukraine\\nhttps://minagro.gov.ua/en\\nhttps://www.me.gov.ua/?lang=uk-UA\\nhttps://customs.gov.ua/en/\\nhttps://dpss.gov.ua/\\nhttps://ucci.org.ua/en/about\\nhttps://commission.europa.eu/about-european-commission/departments-and-executive-agencies/health-and-food-safety_en\\nhttps://commission.europa.eu/about-european-commission/departments-and-executive-agencies/health-and-food-safety_en\\n\\n\\n21 \\n \\n\\ntechnical regulations, standards and conformity assessments to harmonise with those of the European \\nUnion, as well as for technical co-operation in the field of technical regulations, standards and related \\nissues between Ukraine and the European Union. In line with these provisions, the “Comprehensive \\nStrategy of Implementing Legislation on Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures” was approved in \\n2016 and provides for a process of harmonisation of Ukraine’s SPS legislation with EU requirements. \\n\\nIn addition to DCFTA with the EU, a new free trade agreement (FTA) between Ukraine and Turkey \\nwas signed in February 2022. According to the preliminary forecasts, the agreement will increase trade \\nwith Turkey from USD 7.5 billion to USD 10 billion over a period of 5 years30. Earlier in 2019 Ukraine \\nhas signed the FTA with Israel (ratified by the Ukrainian Parliament in July 2019). Overall, Ukraine has \\nbeen a member of the WTO since May 2008. The country charges import tariffs on most agricultural \\nproducts, with applied MFN tariffs for agricultural products averaging at 9.2 percent, well above the \\naverage for non-agricultural products at 3.7 percent. Export duties are applied to some oilseeds, live \\nanimals and raw hides.  \\n\\nTo conclude, more than seven further national sector, export and environmental strategies guide the \\ndevelopment of agriculture in Ukraine. For example, The Strategy for the Export Development of \\nAgricultural, Food and Processing goods until 2026 (2019), National Economic Strategy until 2030 \\n(2021) or Irrigation and Drainage Strategy in Ukraine until 2030 (2019).  \\n\\nB.4. Quality infrastructure in Ukraine and sector specific institutions  \\n\\nB.3.1. QI infrastructure \\n\\nUkraine is continuously taking efforts to adapt to internationally and in particular EUs recognized \\nprocedures for the elaboration of standards, technical regulations and conformity assessment \\nprocedures. The work has taken on a new dimension with the conclusion of the DCFTA. During 2017 \\nan Agreement on Conformity Assessment and Acceptance of Industrial Products (ACAA) has been \\nnegotiated and added as an individual protocol to the existing Association Agreement and EFTA.  \\n\\nThe Ukraine QI is formed taking into account the obligations assumed within the framework of the \\nWTO Agreement on Technical Barriers to Trade and the Association Agreement (AA) (Chapter IV, \\nChapter 3, Articles 53-58 and Annex III). Under Article 56 of DCFTA/AA Ukraine takes the necessary \\nmeasures to gradually achieve compliance with EU technical regulations and systems of \\nstandardization, metrology, accreditation, conformity assessment and market surveillance and \\nundertakes to adhere to the principles and practices set out in current EU decisions and regulations. \\nUnder Article 57 of DCFTA/AA, the Parties agreed to add the Agreement on conformity assessment \\nand acceptability of industrial goods (ACAA) as a Protocol to the DCFTA/AA, covering one or more of \\nthe sectors listed, after full harmonization of Ukraine\\'s sectoral and horizontal legislation, institutions \\nand standards with EU. The ACAA shall provide that trade in goods between the Parties in the covered \\nsectors shall be conducted on the same terms as apply to trade in goods between EU member-states. \\n\\nIn December 2005, Ukraine and the EU signed the Action Plan for the Preparation of the ACAA \\nAgreement. In February 2023, the Parties agreed to intensify the work of the pre-assessment missions \\nof the EU and take steps to start negotiations on the conclusion of the ACAA Agreement. The ACAA \\nagreement is Ukraine\\'s top priority in relations with the EU. ACAA gains particular relevance during \\nwartime, the conclusion of which is an important tool for overcoming technical barriers in trade \\nbetween countries and the expansion of which is possible to all types of economic activities that have \\nexport-import potential. ACAA ensures the elimination of double product certification, improvement \\nof product trade conditions and expansion of trade due to cost reduction (costs and time for work on \\n\\n                                                           \\n\\n30 https://read.oecd-ilibrary.org/agriculture-and-food/agricultural-policy-monitoring-and-evaluation-\\n\\n2022_ee86a0b9-en#page14  \\n\\nhttps://read.oecd-ilibrary.org/agriculture-and-food/agricultural-policy-monitoring-and-evaluation-2022_ee86a0b9-en#page14\\nhttps://read.oecd-ilibrary.org/agriculture-and-food/agricultural-policy-monitoring-and-evaluation-2022_ee86a0b9-en#page14\\n\\n\\n22 \\n \\n\\nconformity assessment, simplification of customs procedures, improvement of SME competitiveness, \\netc.). \\n\\nB.3.2. QI main institutions  \\n\\nThe Ministry of Economy of Ukraine (MEU), with Department for Technical Regulations31 is the \\ncentral governmental body in the QI system responsible for the formation and implementation of the \\nstate policy in the field of standardization, conformity assessment, metrology and market surveillance. \\nThe QI system is presented on the MEU website32. In the field of conformity assessment, the final \\ntransition from the system of mandatory certification in the state certification system to conformity \\nassessment to the requirements of technical regulations has been ensured since 2018. There are 107 \\ntechnical regulations adopted, 95 of which are developed based on the European legislation acts. The \\ninfrastructure of designated conformity assessment bodies to the requirements of technical \\nregulations consists of 67 bodies.  \\n\\nThe Ministry of Agrarian Policy and Food of Ukraine (MAPF) is the main body in Ukraine in charge of \\nthe development of agriculture in Ukraine. Between September 2019 and January 2021 MAPF was \\nintegrated into the Ministry of Economic Development, Trade and Agriculture. Then at the beginning \\n2021 MAPF was restored. According to the Regulation on the Ministry of Agrarian Policy and Food of \\nUkraine, this body forms and implements the state agrarian policy, state policy, technical policy in the \\nfield of agro-industrial complex, and state policy in the field of organic production (department of \\nagrarian development), circulation and labelling of organic products. The right to produce organic \\nproducts (raw materials) is a natural or legal person of any organizational and legal form and any form \\nof ownership, who has passed the conformity assessment for the production of organic products (raw \\nmaterials) in a NAAU-accredited body/laboratory, received a certificate of conformity and included to \\nthe Register of producers of organic products (raw materials).  \\n\\nState Service of Ukraine on Food Safety and Consumer Protection33 is the central executive body \\nunder the jurisdiction of the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine whose operation is directed by the \\nMinister of Agrarian Policy and Food of Ukraine and which implements state policy in the field of \\nveterinary medicine, safety and quality of foodstuffs, quarantine and plant protection, animal \\nidentification and registration, sanitary legislation, protection of public health, certification of seeds \\nand planting material, state supervision in the sphere of agro-industrial complex, state control over \\ncompliance with legislation on consumer protection and implementation of radiation control over the \\nlevel of radioactive contamination of agricultural commodities and foodstuffs. Other relevant QI \\ninstitutions are summarized in the Table below.  \\n\\nTable 2 Main quality infrastructure institutions in Ukraine \\n\\nInstitutions Description \\n\\nNational \\nAccreditation \\nAgency (NAAU) 34 \\n\\n \\n\\nNAAU is a signatory of recognition agreements with the European \\nAccreditation Cooperation (EA BLA), the International Laboratory \\nAccreditation Cooperation (ILAC MRA) and the International Accreditation \\nForum (IAF MLA).

As of 2023, NAAU accredited 62 testing laboratories for \\n\\n                                                           \\n\\n31 https://me.gov.ua/Documents/Detail?lang=en-GB&id=18a56246-ea6b-43c5-bfe2-\\n\\n5512744bbf56&title=DepartmentForTechnicalRegulationAndMetrology  \\n\\n32 www.me.gov.ua \\n\\n33 https://dpss.gov.ua  \\n\\n34 www.naau.org.ua  \\n\\nhttps://me.gov.ua/Documents/Detail?lang=en-GB&id=18a56246-ea6b-43c5-bfe2-5512744bbf56&title=DepartmentForTechnicalRegulationAndMetrology\\nhttps://me.gov.ua/Documents/Detail?lang=en-GB&id=18a56246-ea6b-43c5-bfe2-5512744bbf56&title=DepartmentForTechnicalRegulationAndMetrology\\nhttp://www.me.gov.ua/\\nhttps://dpss.gov.ua/\\nhttp://www.naau.org.ua/\\n\\n\\n23 \\n \\n\\nInstitutions Description \\n\\ncompliance with the requirements of DSTU EN ISO/IEC 17025:2019 (EN \\nISO/IEC 17025:2017, IDT; ISO/IEC 17025:2017, IDT) and the requirements of \\nDSTU ISO/IEC 17025:2017 (ISO/IEC 17025:2017) in the field of grain, seeds, \\nfruit, berries, vegetable and dairy products. \\n\\nNational \\nStandardization \\nBody (NSB/UAS) 35 \\n\\nNSB is determined by the Resolution of the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine \\nof 26.11.2014 № 1163 and is performed by the State Enterprise “Ukrainian \\nScientific-Research and Training Center of Standardization, Certification and \\nQuality Problems” (UAS). The National Standards Fund consists of 38 412 \\nnational standards harmonized with International and European ones.  \\n\\nAccording to the classification of national standards in accordance with the \\ncurrent national classifier NK 004:2020 \"Ukrainian Classifier of Regulatory \\nDocuments\" in selected sectors, there are 860 national standards in force in \\nUkraine by 2023 (by groups of grains and legumes (flour, cereals and nuts, \\nthey do not have their own subgroups); fruit and vegetable; dairy products), \\nmost of which are accepted by the confirmation method, without translation. \\n\\nTechnical \\nstandardization \\ncommittees (TC)  \\n\\nAccording to the first part of Article 15 of the Law of Ukraine \"On \\nStandardization\", a technical standardization committee (TC) is a form of \\ncooperation between interested legal entities and individuals for the purpose \\nof organizing and performing work on international, regional, and national \\nstandardization in specified areas of activity and on established \\nstandardization objects. TCs do not have the status of a legal entity, but \\nconcentrate on the best technical practice, in particular in organic \\nproduction, regarding the development and translation of standards. \\n\\nIn 2023 there were 164 technical committees (TCs) operating in Ukraine, of \\nwhich: actively working TCs – 116, dormant TCs – 44, non-working TCs – 4. \\nConsent for the batch adoption of European standards information was \\nreceived from 136 TCs (87 TCs provided official letters, 49 TCs received \\nconsent via electronic communication), 24 TCs did not provide information. \\n83percent of TCs, despite the military aggression, continue to function, with \\n17percent of TCs - communication is unstable, most of these TCs are located \\nin temporarily occupied territories of Ukraine or near-front territories, which \\nmakes it impossible for them to provide information at this time. \\n\\nMetrology In the field of metrology, Ukraine made the transition to the international \\nmodel of metrology system based on recommendations of the International \\nOrganization of Legal Metrology (OIML). Ukraine has an extensive system of \\nmetrology centres in each regional centre of the country, but the possibility \\nof centralising this system is being considered.  \\n\\nThe list of national measurement standards consists of 83 national standards \\nof measurement units. The calibration and measurement capabilities of \\nnational measurement standards are confirmed by the results of their \\ncomparisons with national standards of other states and international ones \\npublished in the database of the International Bureau of Weights and \\nMeasures (BIPM), to which 314 CMCs lines were entered by Ukraine.   \\n\\n                                                           \\n\\n35 www.uas.gov.ua \\n\\nhttp://www.uas.gov.ua/\\n\\n\\n24 \\n \\n\\nInstitutions Description \\n\\nConformity \\nassessment \\n\\n \\n\\nThe conformity assessment of the production of organic products (raw \\nmaterials) is carried out by the body for assessing the conformity of the \\nproduction of organic products (raw materials) in accordance with the rules \\nof the conformity confirmation procedure and technical regulations in \\naccordance with the legislation on confirmation of conformity in accordance \\nwith the requirements of the Law of Ukraine \"On the Production and \\nCirculation of Organic Agricultural Products and raw materials\". \\n\\nB.3.3. QI gaps in Ukraine fruit and vegetable (with focus on berries and nuts) \\n\\nIn 2023, 409 national standards for groups of fruit and vegetable are in force in Ukraine, most of which \\nare adopted by the confirmation method, without translation. \\n\\nThere are currently 4 national TCs operating in the sector. One of them (TC 24 Vegetable and fruit \\nproducts and equipment for their processing) participates in the work of technical \\ncommittees/subcommittees CEN, CENELEC (in the work of СEN TC 153 Machinery intended for use \\nwith foodstuffs and feed). SMEs make up about 50 percent of the TCs participants. This is an average \\nindicator, but the problem of the low level of qualification and awareness of staff remains open. The \\nlevel of involvement of SMEs of organic products in the activities of national TCs is average and higher \\nthan the average level of 50-80 percent, but the main problem - the attraction of highly qualified staff \\nremains relevant. Currently, there are 8 national TCs for selected types of organic products. The low \\nactivity and participation in the work of technical committees/subcommittees CEN/CENELEC (3 \\nnational TCs) and the absence of TCs that would cover all areas of selected organic products are of \\nparticular concern. \\n\\nDespite the high percentage of participation of the private sector in the activities of the TCs, there is \\na pressing problem with regard to improving the qualifications of personnel. Impact through an \\nintervention in this area of quality and standards would allow expanding the training and consulting \\nsystems for staff in the field. Of particular importance for the development of a competitive sector are \\nthe needs to strengthen the capacity of producers related to safety, hygiene and assessment and \\ncontrol techniques. The basis for the actions will be set in the UAS Digital Transformation Action Plan:  \\nDigitalization for Resilience Connecting Ukraine to the Global Quality Network (developed jointly by \\nUNIDO and UAS).  \\n\\nAs of 2023, NAAU accredited 50 testing laboratories for compliance with the requirements of DSTU \\nEN ISO/IEC 17025:2019 (EN ISO/IEC 17025:2017, IDT; ISO/IEC 17025:2017, IDT) and the requirements \\nof DSTU ISO/IEC 17025:2017 (ISO/IEC 17025:2017) in the generalized field: testing of vegetable \\ngrowing products, forest nurseries, testing of forestry products of organic origin, etc. Most of the \\ntesting laboratories are state-owned. Annex 5 elaborates in detail the main challenges and \\nopportunities for quality infrastructure system in Ukraine (given the focus on berries and nuts value \\nchains), while the main points are already presented below: \\n\\nChallenges for QI system \\n\\n\\uf0b7 Low level of adoption of national harmonized with European standards by the translation \\nmethod. It is necessary to find opportunities to attract funds for high-quality translation of \\nstandards into the Ukrainian language. \\n\\n\\uf0b7 Insufficient level of involvement of highly qualified technical specialists in the activities of TCs \\nregarding the development and translation of national standards. \\n\\n\\uf0b7 Low level of involvement of business, in particular SMEs, in the activities of European and \\ninternational TCs.  \\n\\n\\uf0b7 Lack of high-tech equipment in testing laboratories \\n\\n\\n\\n25 \\n \\n\\n\\uf0b7 Logistical issues and availability of appropriate transport/equipment for fresh produce \\nstorage. \\n\\n\\uf0b7 Low level of digitization of production processes and product quality control programs. \\n\\nOpportunities for QI support \\n\\n\\uf0b7 Needs to strengthen the capacity of producers in safety, hygiene and assessment and control \\ntechniques to comply with international regulations. \\n\\n\\uf0b7 Carrying out an educational campaign and involving the best practices of the EU in this sector, \\nto form competitive producers and exporters. \\n\\n\\uf0b7 Development of infrastructure of certified transport and logistics eco-systems for storage and \\nreloading of products. \\n\\n\\uf0b7 Providing evidence to confirm the eligibility of sector products for the EU marketplace. \\n\\n\\uf0b7 Monitoring of full traceability of products. \\n\\n\\uf0b7 Needs for strengthening the institutional capacity of laboratories, conformity assessment \\nbodies and the purchase of new high-tech equipment. \\n\\nThat is why both fruit and vegetable sector, especially berries and nuts value chains, and the national \\nquality infrastructure system in Ukraine have a significant potential to grow with the support pf Phase \\nII activities. The development of the sector would expand the possibilities of exporting products and \\nimprove NQI in multiple aspects.  \\n\\nB.3.4. Conductive policy environment and culture for quality  \\n\\nThe prevailing culture of the supporting services plays a fundamental role in the generation the \\nenvironment inductive for business and exchange of knowledge and can have a crucial effect on \\nbusiness development. In the export field, quality culture usually influences the levels of strategic \\norientation of organisations, supporting infrastructure and affects decision-making and the outcomes \\nassociated with the export activity.   \\n\\nIn Ukraine the system of Quality infrastructure has already undergone initial transformation in the \\nrecent years and especially with the Phase I However, due to war and its impact on different \\ninstitutions within the QI systems, as well as organizations within/along the fruit and vegetable sector, \\nthe needs and primary challenges might have shifted and changes. \\n\\nTherefore, there is as a strong need to updated current strategic program documents regarding the \\nrecovery of Ukraine\\'s economy: updating the QI development plan, need to reassess the draft and \\nfinalize the strategy of standardization, developing the plan for restoring the traceability of national \\nstandards, lifting the moratorium on inspections, etc. (and for more details see Annex 5). This is what \\nis proposed as part of the inception phase aiming to tailor and address the urgent needs of VC \\nstakeholders.  \\n\\nC. REASONS FOR UNIDO ASSISTANCE  \\n\\nC.1. The UNIDO approach  \\n\\nUNIDO has more than 50 years of experience in technical cooperation applying a systemic approach, \\n“the UNIDO approach”, which has evolved over time to help countries to create a healthy business \\nenvironment for trade and competitiveness.  \\n\\nThe UNIDO approach focuses on the development of productive capacities in particular to strengthen \\ntheir capacity to comply with trade related standards, technical regulations, buyer specifications and \\nmore general increase the productivity and performance of private sector operators. This is \\ncomplemented by the development of quality infrastructure and conformity assessment services as \\nan essential element of enabling the business environment. In particular, UNIDO strengthens national \\nquality infrastructure systems at the level of standards, metrology, and accreditation and conformity \\nassessment services.  \\n\\n\\n\\n26 \\n \\n\\nUNIDO has unique global expertise in QI \\n\\n\\uf0b7 The organization is consistently acknowledged by its stakeholders as a center of excellence for \\nquality infrastructure development. It is the largest multilateral player in quality infrastructure \\ndevelopment and a preferred partner of many developing countries. \\n\\n\\uf0b7 For more than 40 years, UNIDO has been supporting partner countries to increase their \\ncompetitiveness through stronger quality infrastructure systems and compliance with \\nstandards.  \\n\\n\\uf0b7 It develops quality infrastructure systems through targeted interventions that enhance \\nnational capabilities of standardization, metrology, conformity assessment, accreditation and \\nmarket surveillance in order to develop productive capacity, expand their export base and \\nincrease domestic and foreign investment.  \\n\\n\\uf0b7 UNIDO has more than 500 experts and technical advisors who form a unique multidisciplinary \\nteam to support strategic and sustainable quality infrastructure development.  \\n\\nBased on the extensive experience and following international best practices it can be concluded that:  \\n\\n\\uf0b7 Trade facilitation requires a systemic approach. No change is possible with a partial view, \\nfocusing technical assistance only on SME or in a particular aspect.  \\n\\n\\uf0b7 An effective business environment is necessary to help SMEs and other actors to face market \\nrequirements and overall standards and quality issues. Strengthening the QIS is a critical pillar \\nfor intervention; if there is not an effective QIS in place, SMEs will face extra costs that will \\nnegatively affect their competitiveness. \\n\\n\\uf0b7 Quality culture can create an appropriate environment to improve quality, so supporting a \\ndynamic of change at all levels for better competitiveness.  \\n\\nUNIDO applies a systemic, demand-driven approach to quality infrastructure development, focusing \\non private sector and consumer needs which are necessary for countries to create a healthy business \\nenvironment for trade and competitiveness. UNIDO has been involved in a large number of sector \\nfocused quality infrastructure development projects, which focus on addressing specific quality \\nrelated constraints faced by SMEs (from specific VC) and by doing so unlocking their market and export \\npotential.   \\n\\nFor any technical to succeed it is necessary to address simultaneously the following spheres: i) raise \\nawareness and enhance quality culture; ii) enhance QI capacity and services in order to help SMEs to \\ncomply with international standards and raise quality; iii) enhance SME capacity to comply with those \\nstandards. According to the systemic approach, in line with private sector needs, all actors of the VC \\nin particular with regard to their influence of the overall quality, need to be involved in the process. \\n\\nC.2. Global quality and standards programme Ukraine, phase II (2022-2027)  \\n\\nThe UNIDO-SECO Global quality and standards programme is a systematic approach to strengthen the \\nquality and standards compliance capacity to facilitate market access for SMEs. The GQSP aims to \\nencourage systematic trade development along specific sectors by strengthening quality \\ninfrastructure institutions and service providers, enhancing the compliance capacity of private sector \\nactors, particularly SMEs, and creating a conducive rules-based trade and policy environment for all \\nstakeholders. The Programme will pursue three outcomes, thus respond to the main compliance \\nchallenges identified for developing countries: \\n\\n\\uf0b7 Outcome 1: Technical competence and sustainability of the National Quality Infrastructure \\nSystem is enhanced.  \\n\\n\\uf0b7 Outcome 2: SME compliance with international standards and technical regulations is \\nstrengthened.   \\n\\n\\uf0b7 Outcome 3: A conducive policy environment and culture for quality is created.  \\n \\n\\n\\n\\n27 \\n \\n\\nComplementary, a global knowledge management component will analyze and disseminate \\ninformation and knowledge from country experience, which can be used to tackle quality and \\nstandards related challenges worldwide. The programme will thereby focus on knowledge \\nmanagement and sharing, the application of tools developed. Guidance at policy, institutional and \\nenterprise level (for facilitating implementation) will be developed after careful consideration and \\nneeds assessment in areas where UNIDO, through the GQSP, can have a comparative advantage and \\ncontribute to global efforts, while assuming a thought leadership role. In addition, the global \\ncomponent will serve to disseminate knowledge, and identify activities for peer-learning and exchange \\namong developing countries, to further reinforce synergies (e.g. study tours, best practices, technical \\nexchange). The information, knowledge and guidance shall serve to meet the needs of the programme \\nstakeholders, helping them to adapt to the changing environment, particularly in the context of digital \\ntransformation. \\n\\nC.3. UNIDO in Ukraine  \\n\\nUkraine has been a member of UNIDO since 1966 with a Country Focal Point in Kyiv placed in the \\npremises of Ukraine MEDT since 1999. UNIDO has experience in designing and implementing a \\nnumber of technical assistance projects in the country, as well as in the region. UNIDO is currently \\nimplementing the following project in Ukraine:  \\n\\n\\uf0b7 Emergency assistance for 3D-printed prosthetics and job creation in Ukraine, Japan Trust Fund \\n(2023-2024) \\n\\n\\uf0b7 Women and youth economic empowerment in Western Ukraine for inclusive and sustainable, \\nEURO IDF (2023-2027) \\n\\n\\uf0b7 Introduction of Energy Management System Standards in Ukrainian Industry, GEF (2023) \\n\\n\\uf0b7 Environmentally Sound Management and Final Disposal of Polychlorinated Biphenyls (PCBs), \\nGEF (2014-2023) \\n\\n\\uf0b7 Low-carbon economy of Ukraine for climate change prevention: Facilitating investment to \\nscale up innovative cleantech solutions for low-carbon economy and climate action, GEF \\n(2020-2026) \\n\\n\\uf0b7 Global Eco-Industrial Parks Programme – Ukraine, under Component of the Global Eco-\\nIndustrial Park Programme (GEIPP), SECO (2019-2024) \\n\\n\\uf0b7 Industrial capacity-building, policy advice and diagnostics for the green recovery of Ukraine), \\nEURO Trust Fund (2023) \\n\\nD. THE PROJECT \\n\\nD.1. Project objective  \\n\\nThe overall objective of the GQSP Ukraine Phase II is to increase contribution of the berries and nuts \\nvalue chains in Ukraine’s economic development, sustainability and countries’ recovery.  \\n\\nThe main goal of the GQSP Ukraine Phase II is to enhance the integration of Ukraine into regional and \\nglobal trade and promote SMEs competitiveness in the berries and nuts through enhanced quality \\ninfrastructure.  \\n\\nD.2. Theory of change \\n\\nThe mail goal is to be achieved through interventions directed to realize the three outcomes:  \\n\\n(i) Strengthening QI institutions,  \\n(ii) Empowering the business sector, and  \\n(iii) Promoting quality culture and a conducive policy framework.  \\n\\nFor more info, please, refer to the Logical Framework and the Theory of Change.  \\n\\nThe overall UNIDO intervention framework will contribute – together with complementary \\n\\n\\n\\n28 \\n \\n\\ninterventions in the country carried out by other international actors (such as SIPPO and QFTP) – to \\npromote economic development, sustainable livelihood, country’s resilience and recovery.  \\n\\nTo achieve the long-term goal of the project, three necessary transformations need to take place in \\nberries and nuts value chains. These include: \\n\\n\\uf0b7 Strengthening of Quality Infrastructure institutions that evolve and adapt to new trends in \\nthe areas of technology, production, trade, society and environment changes, and provide \\nstate-of the art services that are in line with the market needs, and thereby contribute to trade \\nopportunities for SMEs. This includes relevant technical institutions in the areas of metrology, \\nstandardization, accreditation, and conformity assessment service providers (e.g. testing, \\ncertification, calibration, and inspection) as well as the involvement of other partners, such as \\nbusiness support institutions, research and academic institutions to support continuous \\nimprovements and development of the QIS to cater to the needs arising from changes. This \\nresults in Enhanced technical competences and sustainability of the Ukrainian National \\nQuality Infrastructure System that serves the fruit and vegetable sector, esp. berries and nuts \\nvalue chains.  \\n\\n\\uf0b7 Empowering the business sector, which can be achieved through improved cost \\ncompetitiveness (e.g. through enhanced productivity) or improved delivery capacity (i.e. \\nthrough enhanced collective capacity, cluster development, and other collective efforts). This \\nmeans enterprises would need to have access to competent national quality infrastructure \\nsystems that can verify their compliance; and together with increased knowledge, technology, \\nfinance and incentives to implement standards and quality guidelines should stimulate and \\nenhance their efficiency and productivity individually and at the sector level. Collectively, this \\nwill result in promoted SMEs competitiveness, by means to comply with international \\nstandards and technical regulations, and job creation.  \\n\\n\\uf0b7 Promoting quality culture and a conductive policy framework that can be created through \\n(quality) policy/roadmap/framework to guide development and sustainability of the QIS \\nbased on the country’s potential and demand, and better policy coherence; through a closer \\ncollaboration between QIS, research and educational institutions, industry and the civil \\nsociety; through enhanced awareness and understanding of challenges and opportunities that \\ncan be addressed through quality and standards; and finally through incentives (financial and \\nnon-financial) to encourage adoption of standards and good practices. Continuous exchange \\nbetween actors of the national quality infrastructure, public and private actors ensure that \\ndemand and supply are matched. This results in raised awareness on the importance and \\npotential of quality and standards for the sustainable development of the berries and nuts \\nvalue chains in Ukraine.  \\n\\nThese three transformations are the main outcomes of the project. To achieve these, multiple \\nconditions need to be in place, and require action of various stakeholders. These conditions are \\nbroadly divided into six domains:  \\n\\n1) Policies, standards and regulations  \\n2) Support Institutions, Infrastructure & Services  \\n3) Skills, Technology & Innovation \\n4) Products, Supply chains & Markets  \\n5) Society, Culture & Ecology   \\n6) Finance \\n\\nUkraine’s opportunities to foster the necessary transformations through fruit and vegetable, esp. \\nberries and nuts value chains, lie in several areas/conditions: \\n\\n\\uf0b7 Effective coordination among the national QI institutions \\n\\n\\uf0b7 Collaboration between national and international QI institutions and results recognitions \\n\\n\\n\\n29 \\n \\n\\n\\uf0b7 Demand driven QI-services, meeting private sector needs \\n\\n\\uf0b7 Government interest in mainstreaming quality through regulatory framework and private \\nsector promotion \\n\\n\\uf0b7 The contribution to a better QI system is inclusive, with participation of women and youth \\n\\n\\uf0b7 National, European and international stakeholders are committed \\n\\n\\uf0b7 Climate-friendly development of the sector \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n6 \\n \\n\\n   \\n\\nFigure 3 Phase II project Theory of Change \\n\\n\\n\\n 31 \\n\\nD.3. Selected sector  \\n\\nFollowing the assessment (for details see document ‘’Analysis of pre-selected priority sectors in \\nUkraine for the second phase of the Project in Ukraine”36), Fruit and vegetable sector – with two \\nprioritized product groups/value chains, berries and nuts – has been selected as new value chains of \\nfocus for Phase II. These VCs have shown high economic and export potential. Overall, Fruit and \\nvegetable sector, rank among the top three in terms of both the domestic market of Ukraine (prior to \\nthe full-scale war) and export volumes. Its expansion presents an opportunity to generate additional \\nseasonal employment for rural residents, internally displaced individuals (IDPs), and women. This is \\nfurther supported by the expected value added through an intervention in the area of accreditation, \\nconformity assessment and standardization. \\n\\nD.4.

Outcome 1 \\n\\nOutcome 1: Strengthened QI institutions, by enhancing technical competence and sustainability of the \\nUkrainian National Quality Infrastructure System serving berries and nuts value chains to offer QI \\nservices that better meet private sector needs.  \\n\\nOutput 1.1  [Standardization and digitalization]: Strengthened the national standardization body \\n(UAS) in the development, coordination, and promulgation of standards (including \\nstandards relevant for climate action) with a view of boosting Ukraine regional \\nintegration, including by promoting UAS’ digital transformation. \\n\\nRational: \\n\\n \\n\\nUkraine quality infrastructure system has gone immense transformation and \\nmodernisation in the recent years, which was evident as part of Phase 1. However, it \\nstill faces low level of adoption of national system harmonized with European \\nstandards, particularly in translating them. Beyond that, and especially due to reduced \\nmobility already during Covid-19 time and since 2022 war there is a need to offer mode \\ndigital services. Finally, given the active support from the EU to integrate Ukraine \\nindustry into the European sectors (Ukraine granted with the EU Candidate status), a \\nmore strategic revision of the actions and services is needed. Therefore, the identified \\nneeds, such as translation of the standards, digitalisation of services, assessment of \\nservices provided by National Standards Body with the aim to address most pressing \\nneeds of the export-oriented companies in berries and nuts (and where possible \\norganic) will form the scope of activities within this output. The basis for the actions will \\nstem from the UAS Digital Transformation Action Plan: Digitalization for Resilience \\nConnecting Ukraine to the Global Quality Network (developed jointly by UNIDO and \\nUAS.  \\n\\nActivities: \\n\\n \\n\\n1.1.1. Map and assess QI capacities (incl. conformity assessment) in support of the VC. \\n\\n1.1.2. Facilitate development (adoption) of national standards for selected sectors \\nfollowing international best practices (including translation and dissemination). \\n\\n1.1.3.

Competence and skills development of local experts through trainings and \\nworkshops in the area of standardization specifically related to the selected sectors and \\ndigitalization action plan. \\n\\n1.1.5. Support for NSB in the establishment of an international player in the global \\nstandardisation system. \\n\\nPartners: MEU, MAPF, NSB \\n\\nKey Beneficiaries: Direct: NSB  \\nIndirect: The industry will have better access to improved NSB services \\n\\n \\n\\nOutput 1.2 [Accreditation]: Strengthened the National Accreditation Body (NAAU) in providing \\nservices in alignment with the needs of an integrated regional market. \\n\\nRational: Ukraine has developed a good system of accredited institutions to support fruit and \\n\\n\\n\\n 33 \\n\\nOutput 1.2 [Accreditation]: Strengthened the National Accreditation Body (NAAU) in providing \\nservices in alignment with the needs of an integrated regional market. \\n\\n vegetable sector. However, due to changing needs and geographical reallocation of \\nbusinesses there is current limited number of accredited institutions to support \\nbusiness and market needs. Moreover, there is certain inconsistency in the number of \\nconformity assessment bodies for compliance with the nomenclature and the volume \\nof products produced in Ukraine. Therefore, this output will aim at supporting the \\nnational quality system, esp. NAAU, with the development of the business and action \\nplan to balances number of conformity assessment bodies for compliance with the \\nnomenclature and the volume of products produced.  \\n\\nActivities: \\n\\n \\n\\n1.2.1. Assess current and draft action plan for NAAU in terms of proposing services in \\nalignment with the needs of an integrated regional market and the selected sectors. \\n\\n1.2.2. Provide training and workshops for assessors in technical fields related to \\napplication of relevant standard. \\n\\nPartners: MEU, MAPF, NAAU \\n\\nKey Beneficiaries: Direct: NAAU \\nIndirect: QI institutions in the sector  \\n\\n \\n\\nOutput 1.3 [Metrology]: Strengthened the National Metrology system in providing competitive and \\nmarket-oriented services. \\n\\nRational: \\n\\n \\n\\nUkraine’s metrology institutions, offer services to the laboratories, they experience two \\nmain types of challenges. First of all, there are variations in proficiency testing, which \\nnot follow international (EU) requirements and second of all, they lack high-tech \\nlaboratory equipment, incl. software or digital products to support the comply with \\ninternational requirements. Following this the objectives of this output will be to \\nsupport Ukraine metrology labs in developing skills and getting access to high-tech \\nequipment or digital products in order to calibrate as per international requirements. \\n\\nThis will also incl. ad-hoc activities in the wooden window and children´s furniture \\nsectors from Phase 1 to ensure operationalisation of testing laboratories and for them \\nto make use of the purchased equipment. \\n\\nActivities: \\n\\n \\n\\n1.3.1. Develop competence and skills through trainings and advisory services to allow \\nNational metrology institutes increase its quality of services offered. \\n\\n1.3.2. Provide technical advice on management, business planning and metrology \\ntechnology. \\n\\n1.3.3.

Moreover, with increases \\nprice competition, quality demands on the European market and multiple challenges in \\nthe domestic market many VC participants are not able to get needed certifications to \\ncomply with the EU market regulations. Moreover, there is an overall lack of \\nsustainability standards and traceability schemes in Ukraine, which are also applied in \\nthe EU/internal market, such as of e.g., of GlobalGAP FV. Therefore, the objective of \\nthis output is to support Ukraine conformity bodies (testing labs but also inspection \\nbodies) to introduces processes for sustainability standards and traceability schemes.  \\n\\nActivities: \\n\\n \\n\\n1.4.1 Ensure international recognition of selected CABs (testing facilities, but also \\ninspection bodies) according to relevant standards as demanded by private sector from \\nthe selected sector.  \\n\\n1.4.2. Facilitate quality and relevance of services provided by relevant CABs (testing \\nfacilities, but also inspection bodies) by facilitated workshops, on the job coaching and \\ncarrying out promotional activities.    \\n\\n1.4.3. Increase the technical competence of staff (auditors and inspectors) and \\npurchase services to increase the scope and the reach of accredited certification \\nservices demanded by private sector from the selected sector. \\n\\n1.4.4. Build technical capacities in testing laboratories of wooded windows, particularly \\nin view of making use of the equipment purchased under phase I and promoting their \\nservices to the private sector. \\n\\nPartners: MEU, MAPF \\n\\nKey Beneficiaries: Direct: MAPF, MEU Testing lab, inspection bodies.  \\nIndirect: Industry  \\n\\nD.4.2. Outcome 2 \\n\\nOutcome 2: Empowered the business sector, especially women-led and owned business, by \\npromoting the competitiveness of SMEs operating in the berries and nuts value chains through their \\ncapacity to comply with international standards and technical regulations; and promoting job creation. \\n\\nOutput 2.1  Enhanced private sector capacities to comply with market requirements incl. through \\nmapping of institutional sector landscape with relevant associations and clusters. \\n\\nRational: \\n\\n \\n\\nAlthough almost 10 percent of GDP is coming from agriculture sector in Ukraine and \\nwith a number of sector and business support organizations established, in practice \\ntheir capacity to support business, especially to comply with the EU market \\nrequirements has been quite low. Only recently several BSOs have taken up an active \\nrole in the development of services that address the business needs. However, there \\nefforts lack coordinated awareness, marketing and promotional campaign at industry \\nand sectorial levels. In addition to this, there has been only several strategic export-\\noriented roadmaps specifically supporting berries and nuts value chains. Moreover, \\nsince February 2022 business has been faced by additional challenges related to war. \\nThis way, the activities under this output will aim to establish a clear focus on export \\nmarket strategies re-assess private sector needs, capacities and institutions, that can \\nprovide relevant services to SMEs.  \\n\\nActivities: \\n\\n \\n\\n2.1.1. Conduct an assessment of the private sector capacities to comply with market \\nrequirements and the identification of related gaps.  \\n\\n\\n\\n 35 \\n\\nOutput 2.1  Enhanced private sector capacities to comply with market requirements incl. through \\nmapping of institutional sector landscape with relevant associations and clusters. \\n\\n2.1.2. Mapping of relevant associations and clusters that support producers and \\nintermediate organizations that contribute to increasing compliance and export \\npromotion.  \\n\\n2.1.3. Development of hands-on toolkit (guidelines) for private sector highlighting the \\nopportunities (services, products, trainings, networks, etc.)  that can used from \\nidentified associations, clusters and other VC/QI related organisations to increase SMEs \\nexport compliance and potential.  \\n\\n2.1.4. Awareness sessions to business support entities and SMEs on relevant market \\nrequirements and existing actors along the VC, to enhance their capacity to comply \\nwith standards (such as management standards and voluntary sustainability standards \\n(VSS) and service offered to enhance it. \\n\\nPartners: MEU, MAPF, Ukraine Cluster Alliance, Ukraine EEN Network, Ukraine chamber of \\ncommerce  \\n\\nKey Beneficiaries: Direct: industry, producers, MEU, MAPF \\nIndirect: Sector stakeholders, service providers, BSO and training providers. \\n\\n \\n\\nOutput 2.2 Enhanced the competitiveness of SMEs (esp. women-enterprises) in addressing their \\ncollective efficiencies and their capacity to adopt and comply with standards and \\ntechnical regulations, with a focus on priority products within the VC (in synergy with \\nSIPPO). \\n\\nRational: \\n\\n \\n\\nPrivate sector in Ukraine has been building export competitiveness already for several \\nyears, however, since February 2022 has been facing additional challenges related to \\nsafety of production and its personnel. Although large companies in berries and nuts \\nvalue chains are relatively well aware of the requirements and demands for export to \\nthe EU, it is not the case for SMEs. Moreover, SMEs don’t have enough resources to \\nalso capacitate their staff on new skills and technologies needed for future adaptation \\nand needs of the berries and nuts value chains. In addition to skills, SMEs also lack \\nfunds for R&D programs, products or new certifications.  \\n\\nTherefore, the activities under this output will aim to enhance knowledge and with-it \\ncompetitiveness of SMEs, especially women-led enterprises on the market regulations, \\nrequirements and standards needed to comply to export to the EU and other \\ninternational markets.  \\n\\nActivities: \\n\\n \\n\\n2.2.1. Development and dissemination of guidance tools for compliance with export \\nmarket requirements for the VCs. \\n\\n2.2.2 Support businesses in enhancing their competitiveness and quality of production \\nthrough identifying potential investment opportunities, investment planning and \\nfacilitating investment into upscaling production. \\n\\n2.2.3. Increase companies participation and linkage to relevant sectors BSOs by means \\nof their mapping and awareness raising. \\n\\n2.2.4. Strengthen the capacity of BSOs (incl. Export promotion agencies) to offer \\ndemand driven quality related services, as per needs identified (e.g. training, advisory \\nservices, etc.). \\n\\nPartners: MEU, MAPF, Ukraine Cluster Alliance, Ukraine EEN Network, Ukraine chamber of \\ncommerce \\n\\n\\n\\n 36 \\n\\nOutput 2.2 Enhanced the competitiveness of SMEs (esp. women-enterprises) in addressing their \\ncollective efficiencies and their capacity to adopt and comply with standards and \\ntechnical regulations, with a focus on priority products within the VC (in synergy with \\nSIPPO). \\n\\nKey Beneficiaries: Direct: industry, producers, MEU, MAPF, BSO and training providers \\nIndirect: Sector stakeholders, service providers, private sector. \\n\\nD.4.3. Outcome 3  \\n\\nOutcome 3: Promoted quality culture and a conducive regulatory framework by raising awareness on \\nthe importance and potential of quality and standards for the sustainable development of the berries \\nand nuts value chains in Ukraine. \\n\\nOutput 3.1  [Quality culture]: Promoted a culture for quality in the country, including by raising \\nawareness of the importance of quality and standards and their contribution to the \\ntriple bottom line, climate action and GEEW. \\n\\nRational: \\n\\n \\n\\nUkraine has high potential in producing large and quality volumes of products under \\nfruit and vegetable sector, esp. berries and nuts (fresh, organic, dried). Moreover, \\nbusiness has been doing it already for years. However, looking at the rejection rates \\nand gaps in the QI system in Ukraine, especially with consideration of the EU market, \\nthere is much more awareness needed among BSOs and private sector itself. Mostly, \\nsince the traditional means of receiving information is not possible due to reduced \\nmobility. The poor culture of quality is also present in rural and remote areas, exactly, \\nwhere most of the production sites of berries and nuts take place. Therefore, the \\nobjective of this output is to increase overall culture of quality, including on important \\nstandards and certification schemes for the EU exports.  \\n\\nActivities: \\n\\n \\n\\n3.1.1. Draft an action plan on conduction of awareness campaigns and activities in all \\nspheres of QI related to the sectors. \\n\\n3.1.2. Organize awareness seminars and workshops to exchange good practices among \\nthe stakeholders from targeted sectors relating to quality / good management \\npractices. \\n\\n3.1.3. Develop promotional materials (incl. those produced under Component 1 of \\nGQSP, success stories, guides, relating to the selected VC etc.) together with the \\ndissemination strategy. \\n\\nPartners: MEU, MAPF, NAAU, NSB, Testing labs \\n\\nKey Beneficiaries: Direct: NAAU, NSB, Testing labs  \\nIndirect: industry  \\n\\n \\n\\nOutput 3.2 [Conducive regulatory framework]: Promoted the alignment of the Ukrainian QI system \\nand market with European Acquis, including by supporting reforms and policy making. \\n\\nRational: \\n\\n \\n\\nUkraine has started to develop a strong Quality Infrastructure system and policy \\nframework, especially during Phase 1. However, due to military conflict since 2022 the \\nsituation has changed. Particular, the EC is actively aiming to include Ukrainian private \\nsector in the EU sectors incl. more quality exports from Ukraine. This is also important \\nfor Ukraine to speed and strengthen its recovery and reconstruction ambitions. \\nHowever, many Ukrainian companies and businesses, especially in berries and nuts \\nvalue chains are not fully aware of the opportunities and possibilities that arise. Even \\nwith knowledge and ambition to export, it may come to the lack of knowledge and also \\n\\n\\n\\n 37 \\n\\nOutput 3.2 [Conducive regulatory framework]: Promoted the alignment of the Ukrainian QI system \\nand market with European Acquis, including by supporting reforms and policy making. \\n\\naccess to information on what are the EU requirements and conditions.  \\n\\nIn this way, the activities under this Output will aim to increase overall awareness of the \\nrequired standards and certification schemes, as well as reassess how the QI policy and \\nsystem supports private sector in its ambitions to export and participate in the EU \\ntrade.  \\n\\nThe later will particularly fall under the support scheme to develop the regulatory \\nframework facilitating export of berries and nuts to the EU market. With support of \\nnational and international experts the existing related legislative framework will be \\nreviewed and provided with the recommendations (as guidelines) to be considered by \\nthe Ukrainian public authorities. \\n\\nActivities: \\n\\n \\n\\n3.2.1 Facilitate the dialogue on national strategies and necessary investments for \\nadaptation of targeted sectors for Ukraine recovery and resilience.  \\n\\n3.2.2. Capacity building of policy makers and advise related to strengthening QI and/or \\nexport promotion of the selected sectors. \\n\\n \\n\\nPartners: MEU, MAPF, NAAU, NSB, Testing labs \\n\\nKey Beneficiaries: Direct: NAAU, NSB, Testing labs  \\nIndirect: industry \\n\\nD.5.

Contributions to SDGs  \\n\\nThe project will primarily contribute to SDG9 through improving industrial development and trade, as \\nwell as strengthening a supportive quality infrastructure. Moreover, the project contributes to \\nincreasing income of SMEs and lower income actors in the sector through creating new and bigger \\nmarkets and business opportunities (SDG1). Project interventions targeting individual producers and \\nthen intermediate and business (sector) organizations will support scaling of activities and effect \\nleading to higher results, increased productivity and value addition to sectoral, economic and social \\ntransformation. Therefore, the project is expected to contribute indirectly to SDG8, economic growth. \\nThe project is expected to positively impact livelihood of sector operators many on whom are in rural \\nareas. Therefore, the project will indirectly contribute to reducing urban-rural inequalities (SDG10). \\nBy mainstreaming environmental sustainability, climate change adaptation and resilience across tools, \\nmethodologies and practices, the project will contribute indirectly to SDGs12 and 13.   \\n\\nD.6. Cross-cutting strategies  \\n\\nD.6.1. Sustainability and Scale-up \\n\\nFor any change process to be sustainable, it requires willingness, capacity and corporate social \\nresponsibility to engage in the process. Thus, three preconditions are necessary to achieve the overall \\nprogramme objective: i) create a conducive policy environment, raise awareness and enhance culture \\nfor quality; ii) enhance QI capacity and services in order to help SMEs to comply with international \\nstandards and raise quality; iii) enhance SME capacity to comply with those standards.  \\n\\nA key focus of the project is enhancing the contribution of the berries and nuts value chains within \\nfruit and vegetable sector to economic recovery and reconstruction of Ukraine. The project will be \\nworking closely with the private sector to ensure that interventions and activities are practical, \\nrelevant and commercially sustainable thus providing strong incentive for industry investment. \\nContinued improvements in areas such as the supporting quality infrastructure, traceability and \\ncompliance will not only underpin the industry’s ability to meet European (and international) market \\nrequirements and enable it to integrate stronger in the European sectors facilitating economic growth \\nof singe products, sector and the targeted VC in general. Strong industry representation will enable a \\ngreater strategic approach to export development and provide a conduit to the government for \\n\\n                                                           \\n\\n39 https://decentralization.gov.ua/en/news/12680  \\n\\n40 https://zakon.rada.gov.ua/laws/show/en/526-2019-р?lang=uk#Text  \\n\\n41 https://zakon.rada.gov.ua/laws/show/526-2019-р#Text  \\n\\nhttps://decentralization.gov.ua/en/news/12680\\nhttps://zakon.rada.gov.ua/laws/show/en/526-2019-р?lang=uk#Text\\nhttps://zakon.rada.gov.ua/laws/show/526-2019-р#Text\\n\\n\\n 39 \\n\\ngreater input into effective policy and regulation supporting the industry.  \\n\\nIn the implementation of the GQSP Ukraine Phase 2, UNIDO will focus on upscaling the interventions \\nfrom the first phase, which includes: \\n\\no Align its interventions to the national recovery vision and related strategies of Ukraine; \\n\\no Put beneficiaries in the driving seat. This ensures that project interventions align with local \\nneeds. \\n\\no Building on the good relations with engaged stakeholders and elaborate work plan with their \\nclose engagement; \\n\\no Upscaling the services of national quality infrastructure institutions by introducing digital \\nsolution; \\n\\no Integrate global best practices from international organizations (e.g. ISO), national peer \\ninstitutions (e.g. METAS) and other GQSP countries. \\n\\no Explore possibilities for upscaling the impact, through close dialogue with donors, \\ninternational organizations, technical partners, development finance institutions, academia, \\nthe private sector and consumers. \\n\\no All programmes respect gender balance and equality, good governance and sustainability. \\nThese concepts are central to UNIDO’s mandate and an important part of any quality \\ninfrastructure system. \\n\\nD.6.2. Environmental and social sustainability strategy  \\n\\nThe project will mainstream environmental sustainability in all its interventions. This will include the \\npromotion of resource efficiency and cleaner production, the use of renewable energy along the \\nsector, reducing use of chemicals and harmful materials (including plastic) in the production, \\nprocessing and transportation, etc. \\n\\nMoreover, the project is fully in line with Ukraine’s industrial and sectoral development needs and will \\nrely on the following operational principles for environmental sustainability. According to the updated \\nversion of the Energy Strategy of Ukraine until 2050 (developed by the Ministry of Energy). Besides \\nStrategy the National Emission Reduction Plan (NERP) has been in place since 2017 which is a \\ncommitment of Ukraine to the Energy Community to decommission coal power plants. \\n\\nIn December 2022, the Ukrainian Ministry of Energy and the International Energy Agency signed a \\ntwo-year cooperation program to plan the recovery of the Ukrainian energy system and develop a \\nsafe, sustainable energy future until 2050, with a focus on areas such as energy system security, \\nconservation, low-carbon hydrogen, renewable energy sources, biogas, and data/statistics. \\n\\nThrough the project’s capacity building, local institutional and business support the importance of \\nenvironmental and sustainability standards and regulations will be incorporated and transmitted. The \\ncontent will also be made available in Ukrainian, in order to assure access to information to the \\nrelevant stakeholder groups. \\n\\nAs per UNIDO Environmental and Social Safeguards Policies and Procedures (ESSPP), the \\nEnvironmental and Social screening template has been completed and this project has been \\ncategorized as a category C project. Although no further specific environmental and/or social \\nassessment is required for category C projects, environmental and social aspects will be duly \\nconsidered in all the project activities. Sustainable procurement principles and safety trainings will be \\napplied for any equipment that will be provided and utilized under this project.  \\n\\nD.6.3. Gender mainstreaming strategy  \\n\\nUNIDO and SECO recognize that gender equality and the empowerment of women (GEEW) have a \\n\\n\\n\\n 40 \\n\\nsignificant positive impact on sustained economic growth and sustainable industrial development, \\nwhich are drivers of poverty reduction and social integration.  \\n\\nThe gender mainstreaming strategy and gender equality and empowerment of women objectives are \\nbased on three dimensions (Resources, Rights and Voice): \\n\\n\\uf0b7 Resources: promoting equal access to resources and training opportunities will be achieved \\nby the ensuring that women are given opportunities for skills development. \\n\\n\\uf0b7 Rights: ensuring that quality infrastructure-related (QI) policy and legislative environments \\nare not conducive to discrimination against women. In addition, the safe and non-\\ndiscriminatory delivery of national quality infrastructure-related (NQI) services favourable to \\ntrade will be promoted. \\n\\n\\uf0b7 Voice: enhancing the leverage of women in gaining power and control over their own lives will \\nbe achieved through the promotion of gender-balance within the work environment. \\n\\nOverall, there has been good progress towards gender equality and women’s empowerment in \\nUkraine, but women still face numerous barriers to their full, equal and meaningful participation in a \\nsociety. The situation has been challenges since the beginning of the war in February 2022. Women’s \\ncare burden has increased significantly, with the lack of access to education facilities due to security \\nrisks, women’s engagement in volunteer activities and men’s absence due to engagement in the \\narmed forces has set additional challenges to women participation in business. The armed conflict will \\nincreasingly impact unemployment rates and will likely to continue to push women into the \\nunprotected information sectors of the economy. \\n\\nThe data confirm that the impact of the armed conflict is particularly disproportionate for marginalized \\ngroups, such as female-headed households, IDPs, people with disabilities and so on. Women \\nconstitute the majority of those displaced within and outside of the country, and they face significantly \\nincreased safety and protection risks. Incidents of gender-based violence (GBV), particularly domestic \\nviolence and conflict-related sexual violence, are reportedly increasing. Women are also confronted \\nwith particular challenges in accessing necessary services and are experiencing a greater loss in \\nsources of livelihoods. At the same time, they face increased pressure to provide for their families on \\ntheir own, including by being responsible for earning an income for their household. This can be due \\nto their husband being unemployed, conscripted or deceased or due to family separation. \\n\\nTherefore, it in the inception phase we will assess the reported percentage of women involved in the \\nVC, the share of women-led enterprises and the effect of war on their employability. Project staff will \\nundergo gender sensitization training by taking the UN Women basic e-learning course. All case \\nstudies, reports and best practices will be designed taking gender sensitivity especially given the IDPs \\nwomen into consideration. After the inception phase, specific targets will set (updated) to better \\nmonitor women’s involvement in the project, and sex-disaggregated data will be collected for all \\nsuitable indicators. Specific project interventions will be further developed with gender balance in \\nmind, including the inclusion of gender balanced panels consultative forum planned under Output 3 \\nto promote fair representation, and the integration of gender into standards development42 in Output \\n1. Gender issues identified through in-depth assessment will be further raised with relevant \\nstakeholders and sector actors to influence beyond the limitations of the project interventions notably \\nwith consideration to upscaling. \\n\\nD.7. Link with the Global Programme  \\n\\nThe UNIDO-SECO Global quality and standards programme is a systematic approach to strengthen the \\nquality and standards compliance capacity and facilitate market access for SMEs. \\n\\nThe GQSP aims to encourage systematic trade development along specific sectors by strengthening \\n                                                           \\n\\n42 Reference to UNIDO publication on integrating gender in standards: \\n\\nhttps://www.unido.org/sites/default/files/files/2019-03/UNIDO_Flyer_Standardization.pdf  \\n\\nhttps://www.unido.org/sites/default/files/files/2019-03/UNIDO_Flyer_Standardization.pdf\\n\\n\\n 41 \\n\\nquality infrastructure institutions and service providers, enhancing the compliance capacity of private \\nsector actors, particularly SMEs, and creating a conducive rules-based trade and policy environment \\nfor all stakeholders. The Project will pursue three outcomes, thus responding to the main compliance \\nchallenges identified for developing countries: \\n\\n\\uf0b7 Outcome 1: Technical competence and sustainability of the National Quality Infrastructure \\nSystem is enhanced.  \\n\\n\\uf0b7 Outcome 2: SME compliance with international standards and technical regulations is \\nstrengthened.   \\n\\n\\uf0b7 Outcome 3: A conducive policy environment and culture for quality is created. \\n\\nGQSP Ukraine project is framed within the GQSP Global Programme and follow the same intervention \\nlogic. Based on the experiences of Phase I of GQSP Ukraine and the scope in terms of sector covered, \\nfive main links with the GQSP Global Programme has been envisaged:  \\n\\n1) The use of the Standards Compliance Analytics (SCA), a global tool available at the UNIDO \\nKnowledge Hub, collecting information on trade rejection, which can support the policy \\nprocess as well as technical cooperation, particularly to tailor efforts in addressing compliance \\nissues in a more effective and efficient manner. By providing more detailed information on \\nrejection, this tool contributes to better prepared countries to comply with export market \\nrequirements. \\n\\n2) The use of the Quality Infrastructure for Sustainable Development (QI4SD) Index provides a \\nframework of indicators that summarizes the overall state of development of a country’s \\nand/or region’s Quality Infrastructure readiness. This tool is useful to identify which \\ninterventions are specifically needed within the QI system. \\n\\n3) The use of the Laboratory Network (LabNet), an innovative database available at the UNIDO \\nKnowledge Hub, providing information on services offered by Conformity Assessment Bodies \\n(CABs) around the world in the area of calibration, testing, certification, and inspection. \\nLabNet provides a global overview of all the registered CABs and supports in finding which services \\nare available in the respective country. \\n\\n4) The several e-learning courses related to trade, investment and innovation, including on \\nQuality Infrastructure and Standards, publicly available at the UNIDO Knowledge Hub. \\n\\n5) Concrete synergies with other GQSP projects working in the same sector, namely GQSP \\nGeorgia, GQSP Albania, and GQSP Vietnam, realized by building collaboration through a \\nthematic group at the global level to exchange experiences and best practices in the sector.  \\n\\nD.8. Synergies  \\n\\nThe Government of Ukraine launched several support programs for the sectors related to berries and \\nnuts, as well as agriculture overall, including grants for horticulture, berry growing and viticulture; \\ncompensation for the cost of fruit and berry commercial processing lines. \\n\\nUkrainian Berry Association is a strong sector leader in the promotion of the fruit and berry sector, \\nincluding a focus on organic agriculture. The Association is working with various stakeholders, \\nincluding International Trade Center, USAID “Competitive Economy Program” and others. FAO and \\nEBRD are supporting EastFruit Project, including the exchange of experience in nut production with \\nGeorgia in 2022. Additional involvement of USAID Agro of the subsector is possible. There is a \\npossibility of synergies with GQSP experience in the sector in Albania, Georgia and Vietnam. Brief \\nsummary of further range of projects currently supporting the agriculture sector of Ukraine, where \\nsynergies could be built, is presented in Table below: \\n\\n\\n\\n 42 \\n\\nTable 3 Current projects in Ukraine with synergy for berries and nuts value chains support program \\n\\nProjects Description \\n\\nSwiss-Ukrainian Programs \\n“Higher Value-Added Trade \\nfrom the Organic and Dairy \\nSector in Ukraine” (QFTP) \\n\\nOverall goal is to increase value added trade from the organic and dairy \\nsector, both domestic and export markets, by strengthen product quality \\nand safety in the organic and dairy sector and increasing trade capacity in \\nthe domestic and export markets with consumer products from the organic \\nand dairy sector. \\n\\nThe Swiss Import \\n\\nPromotion Programme \\n\\n(SIPPO) \\n\\nSIPPO is is a well-established mandate of the Swiss State Secretariat for \\n\\nEconomic Affairs (SECO) within the framework of its economic development \\n\\ncooperation.

Project Beneficiaries  \\n\\nDirect beneficiaries: The immediate beneficiaries from the project will be the stakeholders of the \\nberries and nuts value chains (both fresh and processing). Impacting on producers, packhouses and \\nexporters through better practices in the chain that minimize losses, improved efficiencies, value \\naddition, reduction of waste, introduction of new technology improving shelf life, improved capacity \\nto meet the EU market requirements thus improving commercial sustainability by accessing higher \\nvalue more diversified market segments. Improvements in service providers and logistics technology \\nwill also benefit wider Agro industry sector. Supporting government institutions will directly benefit \\nwith better timely access to accurate industry information for planning and policy decisions. \\n\\nIndirect beneficiaries: The improvements to the local quality infrastructure through interventions and \\ncapacity building are readily adapted and used for other horticultural industries. Traceability farm \\ndiary, national database, digitalization of service’s logistic technology adaptions to climate change and \\nimproved testing services and capacity will have a flow across the agro- and agribusiness industry \\nsector. Targeted capacity improvements in delivery techniques of extension services help meet the \\nneeds of all sector actors particularly women who have equal access to information and technology \\ngreatly increasing the potential of adoption. This is especially relevant given for the Ukraine recovery \\nand reconstruction in light of displaced people, industries and resources.  \\n\\nD.10. Key counterparts  \\n\\nThe main counterpart of the Project is the Ministry of Economy (MEU), Department of Technical \\nRegulations and Ministry of Agrarian policy and Food of Ukraine (MAPF).

The monitoring mechanism will be part of the \\ninception report. Day-to-day monitoring of activity and output level will be carried out by the project \\nteam. External Strategic Monitoring will support monitoring at outcome and impact levels in addition \\nto the information available to the project team. To assist with monitoring activities the project \\nintends to establish the traffic light system. Its main features are outlined below. The traffic light \\nsystem is an additional monitoring tool to facilitate the overview of activities enabling early \\nintervention. It does not substitute the monitoring and reporting against the logical framework, which \\nis considered to be much more comprehensive.  \\n\\nTable 5: Monitoring - traffic-light system \\n\\n\\n\\n 46 \\n\\nMonitoring item Green = on track  Orange = needs \\nclose monitoring \\n\\nRed = needs attention  \\n\\nImplementation ratio: percent of \\nfinancial implementation vs. percent of \\ntime elapsed (total project duration) \\n\\nImplementation on \\ntrack: difference \\nbetween time \\nelapsed and \\nfinancial \\nimplementation < \\n15 percent  \\n\\nImplementation \\nslightly delayed:  \\ndifference between \\ntime elapsed and \\nfinancial \\nimplementation 15-\\n30 percent \\n\\nImplementation \\nsignificantly delayed: \\ndifference between \\ntime elapsed and \\nfinancial \\nimplementation > 30 \\npercent \\n\\nKPIs: up to 6 key performance \\nindicators (incl.

The final evaluation will be carried out in accordance with the global program. \\n\\nThe framework of the GQSP 2 builds on the findings and recommendations of the programme’s mid-\\nterm evaluation (2021), which are also reflected in this project. The findings and recommendations of \\nthe final evaluation of the GQSP (2023) will be taken into account during the project inception phase \\n(Dec 2023-May 2024). \\n\\nF. PROJECT MANAGEMENT AND IMPLEMENTATION   \\n\\nF.1 Inception phase  \\n\\nThe project envisages an inception phase of six (6) months. This is highly needed to assess and map \\nthe transformative changes in the economy, QI institutions, production sites and institutional/industry \\nneeds in order to tailor and provide the most needed activities in light of Ukraine recovery. During the \\ninception phase, the following activities will be carried out and associated milestones are to be \\nachieved. The results of the inception phase will be reported in the Inception Report, which will be \\npresented to the SC for approval. The inception report will include the following: \\n\\n\\uf0b7 Conduct a detailed sectoral analysis of the Ukrainian berries and nuts value chain capacities, needs \\nand challenges; together with the private sector associations, relevant government departments \\nand research institutions (e.g. BFH). \\n\\n\\uf0b7 Produce an in-depth analysis of QI institutions and services (incl. conformity assessment) that \\nrespond to the current needs of the selected product/s sector (VC approach), identify gaps and \\nopportunities: i) Detailed assessment of processing waste products volumes, capacity and value-\\nadded options and ii) Identification of pesticide residue requirements for the selected products in \\ndifferent markets. \\n\\n\\n\\n 47 \\n\\n\\uf0b7 Update proposed theory of change for the project targeting berries and nuts value chains in \\nUkraine.  \\n\\n\\uf0b7 Analyse and develop synergies that exist with other donor projects, where applicable develop \\nsynergies, collaborative and leveraging opportunities to be incorporated into project activities.  \\n\\n\\uf0b7 Assess impact of climate change on the berries and nuts value chains including, environmental, \\nphysiological, commercial and social impact assessment, in addition assessing what opportunities \\nmay arise. \\n\\n\\uf0b7 Design a national roadmap and recommendations identifying exact interventions and activities \\nunder each outcome, and the expected results.  \\n\\n\\uf0b7 Finalize project locations, beneficiaries, and partners. \\n\\n\\uf0b7 Establish a monitoring system according to result-based management, incl. baseline scenario and \\ntarget indicators, as well as an M&E framework.  \\n\\n\\uf0b7 Formulate detailed work plan, updated /fine-tuned logframe (including gender disaggregated \\nKPIs) and updated budget. \\n\\nInception Report – The report will include refined project work plan, logframe (with KPIs and baselines) \\nand budget as per needs and gaps identified in the above studies, in collaboration with the industry \\nassociations and government representatives.

Implementation Modality \\n\\nAs a whole, UNIDO will manage the project funds and will be responsible for ensuring prompt delivery \\nof all services and in doing so, it will work in close cooperation with the  Ministry of Economy of Ukraine \\nand other related partners.   \\n\\nThe project owner will perform overall coordination with other agencies and provinces to closely \\ncooperate with UNIDO in implementing the project.  \\n\\nF.4. Project management  \\n\\nUNIDO will perform the overall project management: the overall project management is under the \\nresponsibility of the project manager (UNIDO staff at UNIDO HQ). A project administrator will provide \\ntechnical and management backstopping support. The project office in Ukraine will consist of a full-time \\nproject coordinator and project assistant. International and national experts as required will be recruited \\nfor delivery of specific activities. UNIDO will collaborate with the MEU and other partners to ensure the \\nsmooth implementation of the project and prepare annual reports.  \\n\\n\\n\\n 49 \\n\\nFigure 4 Project management and governance structure \\n\\n \\n\\nThe project team, holding the function of the secretariat, will organize the project steering committee \\nmeetings, consisting of UNIDO Representative, SECO, and MEU. The Committee will review the \\nprogress and will advise on the future work plan annually. In addition, on a regular basis coordination \\nmeeting will be organized with SECO, MEU and other stakeholders as needed. \\n\\nTo achieve the objectives of the project, the recruitment of additional short-term technical experts, \\nboth national and international, is foreseen to implement project activities. The priority will be given \\nto recruitment of national technical experts to ensure cost efficiency, national capacity building as well \\nas sustainability.    \\n\\nF.4. Risks mitigation  \\n\\nGiven the project is taking place in Ukraine, the country with a number of high risk due to war, a \\nnumber of risks have been identified and highlighted in the Annex 2: Risks assessment. Some of the \\nhigh-level risks are high turnover and lack of staff. This can strongly affect the overall absorption \\ncapacity, which comes in addition to a high number of donors and international organizations offering \\nsupport. Therefore, the implementations need to be coordinated carefully. There is a lack of people \\nthat can speak English in key institutions including Ministries. To assure the high level of the \\nimplementation, each risk has listed suggested mitigation measures to account and timely address.   \\n\\nG. INPUTS  \\n\\nG.1. Counterpart inputs to implementation of project activities  \\n\\nIn order to ensure ownership of the project by national counterparts, all project activities will be \\nclosely coordinated with the Ministry of Economy of Ukraine in general and various technical \\ncounterparts for specific interventions. In addition, the national counterparts will appoint focal points \\nfor coordination of overall project implementation. The national counterparts will provide facilities \\nand venues for organization of workshops and trainings. The national project partners and provinces \\nwill contribute in-kind (human resources, existing facilities) \\n\\nG.2. UNIDO inputs \\n\\nUNIDO will designate a project manager not under project funding. UNIDO will be responsible to \\nprovide technical and institutional capacity building in coordination with other institutions and \\npartners. Technical inputs include the sourcing of national and international expertise, which will be \\ndone in close coordination with direct beneficiaries of the respective activities.  \\n\\nH.

It \\n\\nalso defines the roles and obligations for public authorities and organic market operators, and lays out \\n\\nfurther public policy directions for the development of organic product markets.  \\n\\n\\uf0b7 The “Procedure for establishing special conditions for imports of food and animal feed products” (2019): \\n\\nstrengthens the control over imports of food and animal feed goods by the State Service of Ukraine for \\n\\nFood Safety and Consumer Protection. The procedure aims to increase the effectiveness of state control \\n\\nover the imports of food and animal feed products in order to reduce or eliminate the level of threat \\n\\nassociated with the presence of a dangerous factor in the imported products, and remove unnecessary \\n\\nburden during import procedures.  \\n\\n\\uf0b7 The “Resolution on approving the criteria for assessment of level of risk arising from a certification \\n\\nbody’s economic activity in the sphere of organic products, circulation and labelling” (2021): determining \\n\\nthe frequency of planned actions of state supervision (control) by the State Service of Ukraine on Food \\n\\nSafety and Consumer Protection entered.  \\n\\nKEY STRATEGIES REGULATING DEVELOPMENT OF AGRICULTURE SECTOR \\n\\n\\uf0b7 The Strategy for the Export Development of Agricultural, Food and Processing goods until 2026 (2019): \\n\\nThe Strategy aims to enhance the competitiveness of products and expand the export product range; \\n\\nmarket diversification; stimulating the promotion of the Ukrainian food brand and information and \\n\\n                                                           \\n\\n44 https://read.oecd-ilibrary.org/agriculture-and-food/agricultural-policy-monitoring-and-evaluation-\\n\\n2022_ee86a0b9-en#page8  \\n\\n45 Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine (CMU), Ministry of Agrarian Policy and Food (MAPF) (from 29 August 2019: \\n\\nMinistry of Economic Development, Trade and Agriculture, MEDTA) and State Service of Ukraine for Food Safety \\n\\nand Consumer Protection (SSUFSCP).  \\n\\nhttps://read.oecd-ilibrary.org/agriculture-and-food/agricultural-policy-monitoring-and-evaluation-2022_ee86a0b9-en#page8\\nhttps://read.oecd-ilibrary.org/agriculture-and-food/agricultural-policy-monitoring-and-evaluation-2022_ee86a0b9-en#page8\\n\\n\\n 77 \\n\\nKEY LAWS AND REGULATIONS SPECIFIC FOR AGRICULTURE SECTOR \\n\\nanalytical support for the exports of agricultural products, food and processed goods. A related Action \\n\\nPlan clarifies timing and responsibilities for the implementation of a large number of specific measures, \\n\\nsuch as the continuous monitoring and assessment of agricultural markets, online information systems \\n\\nor e-learning opportunities  \\n\\n\\uf0b7 National Economic Strategy until 2030 (2021)46: The strategy set a target for an increase in organic \\n\\nagricultural land in Ukraine. After the outbreak of the full-scale war, Ukrainian Government remains \\n\\ncommitted to the development of organic agriculture. Ukraine’s recovery plan foresees a transition to \\n\\n“green\" growth” of the agri-food sector and further harmonization with the EU legislation. Organic \\n\\nagriculture produces advantageous socioeconomic effects by advancing rural development, creating jobs \\n\\nand providing an opportunity to boost the economy by nurturing the concept of organic trade. Organic \\n\\nfarming creates about 30percent more jobs in rural areas while also producing higher returns on labor \\n\\nthan conventional agriculture. \\n\\n\\uf0b7 Ukraine Innovation Development Strategy 203047 : lists agriculture sector as one with high potential for \\n\\nintegration of innovation technologies, but also to support innovation growth in Ukraine. Agricultural \\n\\nsector has a high potential for modernization, technologies adoption and an processed products. Today \\n\\nagriculture sector in Ukraine creates about 10 percent of the gross domestic product with a potential to \\n\\ndouble it to 20 percent. Considering this, it is the innovative potential that should become the engine of \\n\\neconomic growth and contribute to the development of all spheres of the economy, in particular industry \\n\\nand the agricultural sector. Ukraine has a number of competitive advantages (market capacity, ability to \\n\\ninnovate, availability of educated personnel, scientific schools) that enable it to successfully produce \\n\\nintellectual products, the most profitable of which are innovations primarily (but not only) of a scientific \\n\\nand technical nature. The basis of Ukrainian innovative competitiveness should be human capital, as well \\n\\nas knowledge and results of scientific research. Their effective implementation in Ukraine with the \\n\\npossibility of entering world markets will contribute to the development of the state.  \\n\\n\\uf0b7 National Strategy for Regional Development 2021-202748: recognizes the need to support regional \\n\\ndevelopment in order to increases competitiveness of key strategic sectors, where agribusiness is one of \\n\\nthem (along with ICT and energy). A large emerging market in Europe with a wide range of opportunities \\n\\n- attractive location, human capital, competitiveness and the presence of free trade agreements \\n\\nproviding access to many markets in the world can ensure rapid growth and high return on investment \\n\\nin such key sectors, such as IT, agribusiness, energy, manufacturing and infrastructure.  \\n\\n\\uf0b7 Paris Agreement of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change in April 2016, and \\n\\nratified it in September 2016: Through its Nationally Determined Contribution, Ukraine committed to \\n\\ntotal emissions across sectors, including agriculture, not exceeding 60percent of those in 1990 \\n\\n(equivalent to not exceeding 140percent of those in 2012). In December 2016, the Cabinet of Ministers \\n\\nof Ukraine (CMU) adopted the National Concept of State Policy in the Field of Climate Change up to 2030. \\n\\nThe “Strategy for Low Carbon Development of Ukraine up to 2050” (SLCD) was approved by the Cabinet \\n\\nof Ministries of Ukraine in July 2018. The SLCD defines a co-ordinated approach by various parties \\n\\nconcerned and provides a national vision for separating economic growth and social development from \\n\\nthe increase of greenhouse gas emissions.  \\n\\n\\uf0b7 National Action Plan for Environment Protection until 2025: The strategy define support and protection \\n\\nof the environment, incl. strengthen protection of forests and peatlands, encourage large-scale \\n\\nafforestation, and support to the development of organic farming.   \\n\\n                                                           \\n\\n46 https://www.kmu.gov.ua/en/news/denis-shmigal-uryad-zatverdiv-nacionalnu-ekonomichnu-strategiyu-do-2030-\\n\\nroku  \\n\\n47 https://zakon.rada.gov.ua/laws/show/en/526-2019-р?lang=uk#Text  \\n\\n48 https://zakon.rada.gov.ua/laws/show/695-2020-п#Text  \\n\\nhttps://www.kmu.gov.ua/en/news/denis-shmigal-uryad-zatverdiv-nacionalnu-ekonomichnu-strategiyu-do-2030-roku\\nhttps://www.kmu.gov.ua/en/news/denis-shmigal-uryad-zatverdiv-nacionalnu-ekonomichnu-strategiyu-do-2030-roku\\nhttps://zakon.rada.gov.ua/laws/show/en/526-2019-р?lang=uk#Text\\nhttps://zakon.rada.gov.ua/laws/show/695-2020-п#Text\\n\\n\\n 78 \\n\\nKEY LAWS AND REGULATIONS SPECIFIC FOR AGRICULTURE SECTOR \\n\\n\\uf0b7 Irrigation and Drainage Strategy in Ukraine until 2030 (2019): This nation-wide cross-sectoral policy \\n\\ndocument aims to apply irrigation and drainage arrangements in order to increase yields and make them \\n\\nless dependent of weather conditions.
